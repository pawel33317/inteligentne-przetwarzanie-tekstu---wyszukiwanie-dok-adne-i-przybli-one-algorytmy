revolution when the bolsheviki at the head of the workers and soldiers seized the state power of russia and placed it in the hands of the soviets . naturally most of it deals with red petrograd the capital and heart of the insurrection . but the reader must realize that what took place in petrograd was almost exactly duplicated with greater or lesser intensity at different intervals of time all over russia . in this book the first of several which i am writing i must confine myself to a chronicle of those events which i myself observed and experienced and those supported by reliable evidence preceded by two chapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the november revolution . i am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading but they are essential to an understanding of what follows . many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader . what is bolshevism what kind of a governmental structure did the bolsheviki set up if the bolsheviki championed the constituent assembly before the november revolution why did they disperse it by force of arms afterward and if the bourgeoisie opposed the constituent assembly until the danger of bolshevism became apparent why did they champion it afterward these and many other questions cannot be answered here . in another volume kornilov to brestlitovsk i trace the course of the revolution up to and including the german peace . there i explain the origin and functions of the revolutionary organisations the evolution of popular sentiment the dissolution of the constituent assembly the structure of the soviet state and the course and outcome of the brest litovsk negotiations . in considering the rise of the bolsheviki it is necessary to understand that russian economic life and the russian army were not disorganised on november 7th 1917 but many months before as the logical result of a process which began as far back as 1915 . the corrupt reactionaries in control of the tsars court deliberately undertook to wreck russia in order to make a separate peace with germany . the lack of arms on the front which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915 the lack of food in the army and in the great cities the breakdown of manufactures and transportation in 1916all these we know now were part of a gigantic campaign of sabotage . this was halted just in time by the march revolution . for the first few months of the new rgime in spite of the confusion incident upon a great revolution when one hundred and sixty millions of the worlds most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty both the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually improved . but the honeymoon was short . the propertied classes wanted merely a political revolution which would take the power from the tsar and give it to them . they wanted russia to be a constitutional republic like france or the united states or a constitutional monarchy like england . on the other hand the masses of the people wanted real industrial and agrarian democracy . william english walling in his book russias message an account of the revolution of 1905 describes very well the state of mind of the russian workers who were later to support bolshevism almost unanimously they the working people saw it was possible that even under a free government if it fell into the hands of other social classes they might still continue to starve . the russian workman is revolutionary but he is neither violent dogmatic nor unintelligent . he is ready for barricades but he has studied them and alone of the workers of the world he has learned about them from actual experience . he is ready and willing to fight his oppressor the capitalist class to a finish . but he does not ignore the existence of other classes . he merely asks that the other classes take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near . they the workers were all agreed that our american political institutions were preferable to their own but they were not very anxious to exchange one despot for another i .e . the capitalist class . the workingmen of russia did not have themselves shot down executed by hundreds in moscow riga and odessa imprisoned by thousands in every russian jail and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions in exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of goldfields and cripple creek . and so developed in russia in the midst of a foreign war the social revolution on top of the political revolution culminating in the triumph of bolshevism . mr . a . j . sack director in this country of the russian information bureau which opposes the soviet government has this to say in his book the birth of the russian democracy the bolsheviks organised their own cabinet with nicholas lenine as premier and leon trotsky minister of foreign affairs . the inevitability of their coming into power became evident almost immediately after the march revolution . the history of the bolsheviki after the revolution is a history of their steady growth . foreigners and americans especially frequently emphasise the ignorance of the russian workers . it is true they lacked the political experience of the peoples of the west but they were very well trained in voluntary organisation . in 1917 there were more than twelve million members of the russian consumers cooperative societies and the soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their organising genius . moreover there is probably not a people in the world so well educated in socialist theory and its practical application . william english walling thus characterises them the russian working people are for the most part able to read and write . for many years the country has been in such a disturbed condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of intelligent individuals in their midst but of a large part of the equally revolutionary educated class who have turned to the working people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of russia . many writers explain their hostility to the soviet government by arguing that the last phase of the russian revolution was simply a struggle of the respectable elements against the brutal attacks of bolshevism . however it was the propertied classes who when they realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary organisations undertook to destroy them and to halt the revolution . to this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures . in order to wreck the kerensky ministry and the soviets transportation was disorganised and internal troubles provoked to crush the factory shop committees plants were shut down and fuel and raw materials diverted to break the army committees at the front capital punishment was restored and military defeat connived at . this was all excellent fuel for the bolshevik fire . the bolsheviki retorted by preaching the class war and by asserting the supremacy of the soviets . between these two extremes with the other factions which whole heartedly or halfheartedly supported them were the socalled moderate socialists the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and several smaller parties . these groups were also attacked by the propertied classes but their power of resistance was crippled by their theories . roughly the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries believed that russia was not economically ripe for a social revolutionthat only a political revolution was possible . according to their interpretation the russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power any attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction by means of which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old rgime . and so it followed that when the moderate socialists were forced to assume the power they were afraid to use it . they believed that russia must pass through the stages of political and economic development known to western europe and emerge at last with the rest of the world into fullfledged socialism . naturally therefore they agreed with the propertied classes that russia must first be a parliamentary statethough with some improvements on the western democracies . as a consequence they insisted upon the collaboration of the propertied classes in the government . from this it was an easy step to supporting them . the moderate socialists needed the bourgeoisie . but the bourgeoisie did not need the moderate socialists . so it resulted in the socialist ministers being obliged to give way little by little on their entire program while the propertied classes grew more and more insistent . and at the end when the bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries found themselves fighting on the side of the propertied classes . in almost every country in the world today the same phenomenon is visible . instead of being a destructive force it seems to me that the bolsheviki were the only party in russia with a constructive program and the power to impose it on the country . if they had not succeeded to the government when they did there is little doubt in my mind that the armies of imperial germany would have been in petrograd and moscow in december and russia would again be ridden by a tsar . it is still fashionable after a whole year of the soviet government to speak of the bolshevik insurrection as an adventure . adventure it was and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses and staking everything on their vast and simple desires . already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants . the factoryshop committees and the trade unions were there to put into operation workers control of industry . in every village town city district and province there were soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies prepared to assume the task of local administration . no matter what one thinks of bolshevism it is undeniable that the russian revolution is one of the great events of human history and the rise of the bolsheviki a phenomenon of worldwide importance . just as historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of the paris commune so they will want to know what happened in petrograd in november 1917 the spirit which animated the people and how the leaders looked talked and acted . it is with this in view that i have written this book . in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral . but in telling the story of those great days i have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter interested in setting down the truth . j . r . new york january 1st 1919 . notes and explanations to the average reader the multiplicity of russian organisationspolitical groups committees and central committees soviets dumas and unionswill prove extremely confusing . for this reason i am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations . political parties in the elections to the constituent assembly there were seventeen tickets in petrograd and in some of the provincial towns as many as forty but the following summary of the aims and composition of political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in this book . only the essence of their programmes and the general character of their constituencies can be noticed . . . . 1 . monarchists of various shades octobrists etc . these oncepowerful factions no longer existed openly they either worked underground or their members joined the cadets as the cadets came by degrees to stand for their political programme . representatives in this book rodzianko shulgin . 2 . cadets . socalled from the initials of its name constitutional democrats . its official name is party of the peoples freedom . under the tsar composed of liberals from the propertied classes the cadets were the great party of political reform roughly corresponding to the progressive party in america . when the revolution broke out in march 1917 the cadets formed the first provisional government . the cadet ministry was overthrown in april because it declared itself in favour of allied imperialistic aims including the imperialistic aims of the tsars government . as the revolution became more and more a social economic revolution the cadets grew more and more conservative . its representatives in this book are miliukov vinaver shatsky . 2a . group of public men . after the cadets had become unpopular through their relations with the kornilov counterrevolution the group of public men was formed in moscow . delegates from the group of public men were given portfolios in the last kerensky cabinet . the group declared itself nonpartisan although its intellectual leaders were men like rodzianko and shulgin . it was composed of the more modern bankers merchants and manufacturers who were intelligent enough to realise that the soviets must be fought by their own weaponeconomic organisation . typical of the group lianozov konovalov . 3 . populist socialists or trudoviki labour group . numerically a small party composed of cautious intellectuals the leaders of the cooperative societies and conservative peasants . professing to be socialists the populists really supported the interests of the petty bourgeoisieclerks shopkeepers etc . by direct descent inheritors of the compromising tradition of the labour group in the fourth imperial duma which was composed largely of peasant representatives . kerensky was the leader of the trudoviki in the imperial duma when the revolution of march 1917 broke out . the populist socialists are a nationalistic party . their representatives in this book are peshekhanov tchaikovsky . 4 . russian social democratic labour party . originally marxian socialists . at a party congress held in 1903 the party split on the question of tactics into two factionsthe majority bolshinstvo and the minority menshinstvo . from this sprang the names bolsheviki and menshevikimembers of the majority and members of the minority . these two wings became two separate parties both calling themselves russian social democratic labour party and both professing to be marxians . since the revolution of 1905 the bolsheviki were really the minority becoming again the majority in september 1917 . a . mensheviki . this party includes all shades of socialists who believe that society must progress by natural evolution toward socialism and that the workingclass must conquer political power first . also a nationalistic party . this was the party of the socialist intellectuals which means all the means of education having been in the hands of the propertied classes the intellectuals instinctively reacted to their training and took the side of the propertied classes . among their representatives in this book are dan lieber tseretelli . b . mensheviki internationalists . the radical wing of the mensheviki internationalists and opposed to all coalition with the propertied classes yet unwilling to break loose from the conservative mensheviki and opposed to the dictatorship of the workingclass advocated by the bolsheviki . trotzky was long a member of this group . among their leaders martov martinov . c . bolsheviki . now call themselves the communist party in order to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of moderate or parliamentary socialism which dominates the mensheviki and the socalled majority socialists in all countries . the bolsheviki proposed immediate proletarian insurrection and seizure of the reins of government in order to hasten the coming of socialism by forcibly taking over industry land natural resources and financial institutions . this party expresses the desires chiefly of the factory workers but also of a large section of the poor peasants . the name bolshevik can not be translated by maximalist . the maximalists are a separate group . see paragraph 5b . among the leaders lenin trotzky lunatcharsky . d . united social democrats internationalists . also called the novaya zhizn new life group from the name of the very influential newspaper which was its organ . a little group of intellectuals with a very small following among the workingclass except the personal following of maxim gorky its leader . intellectuals with almost the same programme as the mensheviki internationalists except that the novaya zhizn group refused to be tied to either of the two great factions . opposed the bolshevik tactics but remained in the soviet government . other representatives in this book avilov kramarov . e . yedinstvo . a very small and dwindling group composed almost entirely of the personal following of plekhanov one of the pioneers of the russian social democratic movement in the 80s and its greatest theoretician . now an old man plekhanov was extremely patriotic too conservative even for the mensheviki . after the bolshevik coup detat yedinstvo disappeared . 5 . socialist revolutionary party . called essaires from the initials of their name . originally the revolutionary party of the peasants the party of the fighting organisationsthe terrorists . after the march revolution it was joined by many who had never been socialists . at that time it stood for the abolition of private property in land only the owners to be compensated in some fashion . finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the essaires to abandon the compensation clause and led to the younger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main party in the fall of 1917 and forming a new party the left socialist revolutionary party . the essaires who were afterward always called by the radical groups right socialist revolutionaries adopted the political attitude of the mensheviki and worked together with them . they finally came to represent the wealthier peasants the intellectuals and the politically uneducated populations of remote rural districts . among them there was however a wider difference of shades of political and economic opinion than among the mensheviki . among their leaders mentioned in these pages avksentiev gotz kerensky tchernov babuschka breshkovskaya . a . left socialist revolutionaries . although theoretically sharing the bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the workingclass at first were reluctant to follow the ruthless bolshevik tactics . however the left socialist revolutionaries remained in the soviet government sharing the cabinet portfolios especially that of agriculture . they withdrew from the government several times but always returned . as the peasants left the ranks of the essaires in increasing numbers they joined the left socialist revolutionary party which became the great peasant party supporting the soviet government standing for confiscation without compensation of the great landed estates and their disposition by the peasants themselves . among the leaders spiridonova karelin kamkov kalagayev . b . maximalists . an offshoot of the socialist revolutionary party in the revolution of 1905 when it was a powerful peasant movement demanding the immediate application of the maximum socialist programme . now an insignificant group of peasant anarchists . parliamentary procedure russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental model rather than our own . the first action is usually the election of officers and the presidium . the presidium is a presiding committee composed of representatives of the groups and political factions represented in the assembly in proportion to their numbers . the presidium arranges the order of business and its members can be called upon by the president to take the chair pro tem . each question vopros is stated in a general way and then debated and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by the different factions and each one voted on separately . the order of business can be and usually is smashed to pieces in the first half hour . on the plea of emergency which the crowd almost always grants anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any subject . the crowd controls the meeting practically the only functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little bell and to recognise speakers . almost all the real work of the session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political factions which almost always cast their votes in a body and are represented by floorleaders . the result is however that at every important new point or vote the session takes a recess to enable the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus . the crowd is extremely noisy cheering or heckling speakers overriding the plans of the presidium . among the customary cries are prosim please go on pravilno or eto vierno thats true right do volno enough doloi down with him posor shame and teesche silence not so noisy popular organisations 1 . soviet . the word soviet means council . under the tsar the imperial council of state was called gosudarstvennyi soviet . since the revolution however the term soviet has come to be associated with a certain type of parliament elected by members of workingclass economic organisationsthe soviet of workers of soldiers or of peasants deputies . i have therefore limited the word to these bodies and wherever else it occurs i have translated it council . besides the local soviets elected in every city town and village of russiaand in large cities also ward raionny sovietsthere are also the oblastne or gubiernsky district or provincial soviets and the central executive committee of the allrussian soviets in the capital called from its initials tsayeekah . see below central committees . almost everywhere the soviets of workers and of soldiers deputies combined very soon after the march revolution . in special matters concerning their peculiar interests however the workers and the soldiers sections continued to meet separately . the soviets of peasants deputies did not join the other two until after the bolshevik coup detat . they too were organised like the workers and soldiers with an executive committee of the allrussian peasants soviets in the capital . 2 . trade unions . although mostly industrial in form the russian labour unions were still called trade unions and at the time of the bolshevik revolution had from three to four million members . these unions were also organised in an allrussian body a sort of russian federation of labour which had its central executive committee in the capital . 3 . factoryshop committees . these were spontaneous organisations created in the factories by the workers in their attempt to control industry taking advantage of the administrative breakdown incident upon the revolution . their function was by revolutionary action to take over and run the factories . the factoryshop committees also had their allrussian organisation with a central committee at petrograd which cooperated with the trade unions . 4 . dumas . the word duma means roughly deliberative body . the old imperial duma which persisted six months after the revolution in a democratised form died a natural death in september 1917 . the city duma referred to in this book was the reorganised municipal council often called municipal selfgovernment . it was elected by direct and secret ballot and its only reason for failure to hold the masses during the bolshevik revolution was the general decline in influence of all purely political representation in the fact of the growing power of organisations based on economic groups . 5 . zemstvos . may be roughly translated county councils . under the tsar semipolitical semisocial bodies with very little administrative power developed and controlled largely by intellectual liberals among the landowning classes . their most important function was education and social service among the peasants . during the war the zemstvos gradually took over the entire feeding and clothing of the russian army as well as the buying from foreign countries and work among the soldiers generally corresponding to the work of the american y . m . c . a . at the front . after the march revolution the zemstvos were democratized with a view to making them the organs of local government in the rural districts . but like the city dumas they could not compete with the soviets . 6 . cooperatives . these were the workers and peasants consumers cooperative societies which had several million members all over russia before the revolution . founded by liberals and moderate socialists the cooperative movement was not supported by the revolutionary socialist groups because it was a substitute for the complete transference of means of production and distribution into the hands of the workers . after the march revolution the cooperatives spread rapidly and were dominated by populist socialists mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and acted as a conservative political force until the bolshevik revolution . however it was the cooperatives which fed russia when the old structure of commerce and transportation collapsed . 7 . army committees . the army committees were formed by the soldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the old regime officers . every company regiment brigade division and corps had its committee over all of which was elected the army committee . the central army committee cooperated with the general staff . the administrative breakdown in the army incident upon the revolution threw upon the shoulders of the army committees most of the work of the quartermasters department and in some cases even the command of troops . 8 . fleet committees . the corresponding organisations in the navy . central committees in the spring and summer of 1917 allrussian conventions of every sort of organisation were held at petrograd . there were national congresses of workers soldiers and peasants soviets trade unions factoryshop committees army and fleet committeesbesides every branch of the military and naval service cooperatives nationalities etc . each of these conventions elected a central committee or a central executive committee to guard its particular interests at the seat of government . as the provisional government grew weaker these central committees were forced to assume more and more administrative powers . the most important central committees mentioned in this book are union of unions . during the revolution of 1905 professor miliukov and other liberals established unions of professional mendoctors lawyers physicians etc . these were united under one central organisation the union of unions . in 1905 the union of unions acted with the revolutionary democracy in 1917 however the union of unions opposed the bolshevik uprising and united the government employees who went on strike against the authority of the soviets . tsayeekah . allrussian central executive committee of the soviets of workers and soldiers deputies . so called from the initials of its name . tsentroflot . centrefleetthe central fleet committee . vikzhel . allrussian central committee of the railway workers union . so called from the initials of its name . other organisations red guards . the armed factory workers of russia . the red guards were first formed during the revolution of 1905 and sprang into existence again in the days of march 1917 when a force was needed to keep order in the city . at that time they were armed and all efforts of the provisional government to disarm them were more or less unsuccessful . at every great crisis in the revolution the red guards appeared on the streets untrained and undisciplined but full of revolutionary zeal . white guards . bourgeois volunteers who emerged in the last stages of the revolution to defend private property from the bolshevik attempt to abolish it . a great many of them were university students . tekhintsi . the socalled savage division in the army made up of mohametan tribesmen from central asia and personally devoted to general kornilov . the tekhintsi were noted for their blind obedience and their savage cruelty in warfare . death battalions . or shock battalions . the womens battalion is known to the world as the death battalion but there were many death battalions composed of men . these were formed in the summer of 1917 by kerensky for the purpose of strengthening the discipline and combative fire of the army by heroic example . the death battalions were composed mostly of intense young patriots . these came for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes . union of officers . an organisation formed among the reactionary officers in the army to combat politically the growing power of the army committees . knights of st . george . the cross of st . george was awarded for distinguished action in battle . its holder automatically became a knight of st . george . the predominant influence in the organisation was that of the supporters of the military idea . peasants union . in 1905 the peasants union was a revolutionary peasants organisation . in 1917 however it had become the political expression of the more prosperous peasants to fight the growing power and revolutionary aims of the soviets of peasants deputies . chronology and spelling i have adopted in this book our calendar throughout instead of the former russian calendar which was thirteen days earlier . in the spelling of russian names and words i have made no attempt to follow any scientific rules for transliteration but have tried to give the spelling which would lead the englishspeaking reader to the simplest approximation of their pronunciation . sources much of the material in this book is from my own notes . i have also relied however upon a heterogeneous file of several hundred assorted russian newspapers covering almost every day of the time described of files of the english paper the russian daily news and of the two french papers journal de russie and entente . but far more valuable than these is the bulletin de la presse issued daily by the french information bureau in petrograd which reports all important happenings speeches and the comment of the russian press . of this i have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917 to the end of january 1918 . besides the foregoing i have in my possession almost every proclamation decree and announcement posted on the walls of petrograd from the middle of september 1917 to the end of january 1918 . also the official publication of all government decrees and orders and the official government publication of the secret treaties and other documents discovered in the ministry of foreign affairs when the bolsheviki took it over . ten days that shook the world chapter i background toward the end of september 1917 an alien professor of sociology visiting russia came to see me in petrograd . he had been informed by business men and intellectuals that the revolution was slowing down . the professor wrote an article about it and then travelled around the country visiting factory towns and peasant communitieswhere to his astonishment the revolution seemed to be speeding up . among the wageearners and the landworking people it was common to hear talk of all land to the peasants all factories to the workers . if the professor had visited the front he would have heard the whole army talking peace . . . . the professor was puzzled but he need not have been both observations were correct . the propertyowning classes were becoming more conservative the masses of the people more radical . there was a feeling among business men and the intelligentzia generally that the revolution had gone quite far enough and lasted too long that things should settle down . this sentiment was shared by the dominant moderate socialist groups the oborontsi see app . i sect . 1 mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries who supported the provisional government of kerensky . on october 14th the official organ of the moderate socialists said the drama of revolution has two acts the destruction of the old rgime and the creation of the new one . the first act has lasted long enough . now it is time to go on to the second and to play it as rapidly as possible . as a great revolutionist put it let us hasten friends to terminate the revolution . he who makes it last too long will not gather the fruits . . . . among the worker soldier and peasant masses however there was a stubborn feeling that the first act was not yet played out . on the front the army committees were always running foul of officers who could not get used to treating their men like human beings in the rear the land committees elected by the peasants were being jailed for trying to carry out government regulations concerning the land and the workmen see app . i sect . 2 in the factories were fighting blacklists and lockouts . nay furthermore returning political exiles were being excluded from the country as undesirable citizens and in some cases men who returned from abroad to their villages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary acts committed in 1905 . to the multiform discontent of the people the moderate socialists had one answer wait for the constituent assembly which is to meet in december . but the masses were not satisfied with that . the constituent assembly was all well and good but there were certain definite things for which the russian revolution had been made and for which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark brotherhood grave on mars field that must be achieved constituent assembly or no constituent assembly peace land and workers control of industry . the constituent assembly had been postponed and postponedwould probably be postponed again until the people were calm enoughperhaps to modify their demands at any rate here were eight months of the revolution gone and little enough to show for it . . . . meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simply deserting the peasants burned manorhouses and took over the great estates the workers sabotaged and struck . . . . of course as was natural the manufacturers landowners and army officers exerted all their influence against any democratic compromise . . . . the policy of the provisional government alternated between ineffective reforms and stern repressive measures . an edict from the socialist minister of labour ordered all the workers committees henceforth to meet only after working hours . among the troops at the front agitators of opposition political parties were arrested radical newspapers closed down and capital punishment appliedto revolutionary propagandists . attempts were made to disarm the red guard . cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces . . . . these measures were supported by the moderate socialists and their leaders in the ministry who considered it necessary to cooperate with the propertied classes . the people rapidly deserted them and went over to the bolsheviki who stood for peace land and workers control of industry and a government of the workingclass . in september 1917 matters reached a crisis . against the overwhelming sentiment of the country kerensky and the moderate socialists succeeded in establishing a government of coalition with the propertied classes and as a result the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever . an article in rabotchi put workers way about the middle of october entitled the socialist ministers expressed the feeling of the masses of the people against the moderate socialists here is a list of their services .see app . i sect . 3 tseretelli disarmed the workmen with the assistance of general polovtsev checkmated the revolutionary soldiers and approved of capital punishment in the army . skobeliev commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100 of their profits and finishedand finished by an attempt to dissolve the workers committees in the shops and factories . avksentiev put several hundred peasants in prison members of the land committees and suppressed dozens of workers and soldiers newspapers . tchernov signed the imperial manifest ordering the dissolution of the finnish diet . savinkov concluded an open alliance with general kornilov . if this saviour of the country was not able to betray petrograd it was due to reasons over which he had no control . zarudny with the sanction of alexinsky and kerensky put some of the best workers of the revolution soldiers and sailors in prison . nikitin acted as a vulgar policeman against the railway workers . kerensky it is better not to say anything about him . the list of his services is too long . . . . a congress of delegates of the baltic fleet at helsingfors passed a resolution which began as follows we demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the provisional government of the socialist the political adventurerkerensky as one who is scandalising and ruining the great revolution and with it the revolutionary masses by his shameless political blackmail on behalf of the bourgeoisie . . . . the direct result of all this was the rise of the bolsheviki . . . . since march 1917 when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers beating upon the tauride palace compelled the reluctant imperial duma to assume the supreme power in russia it was the masses of the people workers soldiers and peasants which forced every change in the course of the revolution . they hurled the miliukov ministry down it was their soviet which proclaimed to the world the russian peace termsno annexations no indemnities and the right of selfdetermination of peoples and again in july it was the spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once more stormed the tauride palace to demand that the soviets take over the government of russia . the bolsheviki then a small political sect put themselves at the head of the movement . as a result of the disastrous failure of the rising public opinion turned against them and their leaderless hordes slunk back into the viborg quarter which is petrograds st . antoine . then followed a savage hunt of the bolsheviki hundreds were imprisoned among them trotzky madame kollontai and kameniev lenin and zinoviev went into hiding fugitives from justice the bolshevik papers were suppressed . provocators and reactionaries raised the cry that the bolsheviki were german agents until people all over the world believed it . but the provisional government found itself unable to substantiate its accusations the documents proving progerman conspiracy were discovered to be forgeries and one by one the bolsheviki were part of the famous sisson documents released from prison without trial on nominal or no bailuntil only six remained . the impotence and indecision of the everchanging provisional government was an argument nobody could refute . the bolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses all power to the sovietsand they were not merely selfseeking for at that time the majority of the soviets was moderate socialist their bitter enemy . but more potent still they took the crude simple desires of the workers soldiers and peasants and from them built their immediate programme . and so while the oborontsi mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the bourgeoisie the bolsheviki rapidly captured the russian masses . in july they were hunted and despised by september the metropolitan workmen the sailors of the baltic fleet and the soldiers had been won almost entirely to their cause . the september municipal elections in the large cities see app . i sect . 4 were significant only 18 per cent of the returns were menshevik and socialist revolutionary against more than 70 per cent in june . . . . there remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers the fact that the central executive committees of the soviets the central army and fleet committees and the central committees of some of see notes and explanations . the unionsnotably the post and telegraph workers and the railway workersopposed the bolsheviki with the utmost violence . these central committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer or even before when the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries had an enormous following and they delayed or prevented any new elections . thus according to the constitution of the soviets of workers and soldiers deputies the allrussian congress should have been called in september but the tsayeekah would not see notes and explanations . call the meeting on the ground that the constituent assembly was only two months away at which time they hinted the soviets would abdicate . meanwhile one by one the bolsheviki were winning in the local soviets all over the country in the union branches and the ranks of the soldiers and sailors . the peasants soviets remained still conservative because in the sluggish rural districts political consciousness developed slowly and the socialist revolutionary party had been for a generation the party which had agitated among the peasants . . . . but even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was forming . it showed itself clearly in october when the left wing of the socialist revolutionaries split off and formed a new political faction the left socialist revolutionaries . at the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces of reaction were gaining confidence .see app . i sect . 5 at the troitsky farce theatre in petrograd for example a burlesque called sins of the tsar was interrupted by a group of monarchists who threatened to lynch the actors for insulting the emperor . certain newspapers began to sigh for a russian napoleon . it was the usual thing among bourgeois intelligentzia to refer to the soviets of workers deputies rabotchikh deputatov as sabatchikh deputatovdogs deputies . on october 15th i had a conversation with a great russian capitalist stepan georgevitch lianozov known as the russian rockefellera cadet by political faith . revolution he said is a sickness . sooner or later the foreign powers must intervene hereas one would intervene to cure a sick child and teach it how to walk . of course it would be more or less improper but the nations must realise the danger of bolshevism in their own countriessuch contagious ideas as proletarian dictatorship and world social revolution . . . there is a chance that this intervention may not be necessary . transportation is demoralised the factories are closing down and the germans are advancing . starvation and defeat may bring the russian people to their senses . . . . mr . lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened it would be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit the existence of the workers shop committees or to allow the workers any share in the management of industry . as for the bolsheviki they will be done away with by one of two methods . the government can evacuate petrograd then a state of siege declared and the military commander of the district can deal with these gentlemen without legal formalities . . . . or if for example the constituent assembly manifests any utopian tendencies it can be dispersed by force of arms . . . . winter was coming onthe terrible russian winter . i heard business men speak of it so winter was always russias best friend . perhaps now it will rid us of revolution . on the freezing front miserable armies continued to starve and die without enthusiasm . the railways were breaking down food lessening factories closing . the desperate masses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of the people causing defeat on the front . riga had been surrendered just after general kornilov said publicly must we pay with riga the price of bringing the country to a sense of its duty see kornilov to brestlitvosk by john reed . boni and liveright n .y . 1919 to americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to such a pitch . but i have personally met officers on the northern front who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with the soldiers committees . the secretary of the petrograd branch of the cadet party told me that the breakdown of the countrys economic life was part of a campaign to discredit the revolution . an allied diplomat whose name i promised not to mention confirmed this from his own knowledge . i know of certain coalmines near kharkov which were fired and flooded by their owners of textile factories at moscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of crippling locomotives . . . . a large section of the propertied classes preferred the germans to the revolutioneven to the provisional governmentand didnt hesitate to say so . in the russian household where i lived the subject of conversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming of the germans bringing law and order . . . . one evening i spent at the house of a moscow merchant during tea we asked the eleven people at the table whether they preferred wilhelm or the bolsheviki . the vote was ten to one for wilhelm . . . the speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation to pile up fortunes and to spend them in fantastic revelry or the corruption of government officials . foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded or secretly sent out of the country to sweden . in the first four months of the revolution for example the reserve foodsupplies were almost openly looted from the great municipal warehouses of petrograd until the twoyears provision of grain had fallen to less than enough to feed the city for one month . . . . according to the official report of the last minister of supplies in the provisional government coffee was bought wholesale in vladivostok for two rubles a pound and the consumer in petrograd paid thirteen . in all the stores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing but only the rich could buy them . in a provincial town i knew a merchant family turned speculatormaradior bandit ghoul the russians call it . the three sons had bribed their way out of military service . one gambled in foodstuffs . another sold illegal gold from the lena mines to mysterious parties in finland . the third owned a controlling interest in a chocolate factory which supplied the local cooperative societieson condition that the cooperatives furnished him everything he needed . and so while the masses of the people got a quarter pound of black bread on their bread cards he had an abundance of white bread sugar tea candy cake and butter . . . . yet when the soldiers at the front could no longer fight from cold hunger and exhaustion how indignantly did this family scream cowardshow ashamed they were to be russians . . . when finally the bolsheviki found and requisitioned vast hoarded stores of provisions what robbers they were . beneath all this external rottenness moved the oldtime dark forces unchanged since the fall of nicholas the second secret still and very active . the agents of the notorious okhrana still functioned for and against the tsar for and against kerenskywhoever would pay . . . . in the darkness underground organisations of all sorts such as the black hundreds were busy attempting to restore reaction in some form or other . in this atmosphere of corruption of monstrous halftruths one clear note sounded day after day the deepening chorus of the bolsheviki all power to the soviets all power to the direct representatives of millions on millions of common workers soldiers peasants . land bread an end to the senseless war an end to secret diplomacy speculation treachery . . . . the revolution is in danger and with it the cause of the people all over the world the struggle between the proletariat and the middle class between the soviets and the government which had begun in the first march days was about to culminate . having at one bound leaped from the middle ages into the twentieth century russia showed the startled world two systems of revolutionthe political and the socialin mortal combat . what a revelation of the vitality of the russian revolution after all these months of starvation and disillusionment the bourgeoisie should have better known its russia . not for a long time in russia will the sickness of revolution have run its course . . . . looking back russia before the november insurrection seems of another age almost incredibly conservative . so quickly did we adapt ourselves to the newer swifter life just as russian politics swung bodily to the leftuntil the cadets were outlawed as enemies of the people kerensky became a counterrevolutionist the middle socialist leaders tseretelli dan lieber gotz and avksentiev were too reactionary for their following and men like victor tchernov and even maxim gorky belonged to the right wing . . . . about the middle of december 1917 a group of socialist revolutionary leaders paid a private visit to sir george buchanan the british ambassador and implored him not to mention the fact that they had been there because they were considered too far right . and to think said sir george . one year ago my government instructed me not to receive miliukov because he was so dangerously left september and october are the worst months of the russian yearespecially the petrograd year . under dull grey skies in the shortening days the rain fell drenching incessant . the mud underfoot was deep slippery and clinging tracked everywhere by heavy boots and worse than usual because of the complete breakdown of the municipal administration . bitter damp winds rushed in from the gulf of finland and the chill fog rolled through the streets . at night for motives of economy as well as fear of zeppelins the streetlights were few and far between in private dwellings and apartmenthouses the electricity was turned on from six oclock until midnight with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to be had . it was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning . robberies and housebreakings increased . in apartment houses the men took turns at allnight guard duty armed with loaded rifles . this was under the provisional government . week by week food became scarcer . the daily allowance of bread fell from a pound and a half to a pound then three quarters half and a quarterpound . toward the end there was a week without any bread at all . sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a monthif one could get it at all which was seldom . a bar of chocolate or a pound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rublesat least a dollar . there was milk for about half the babies in the city most hotels and private houses never saw it for months . in the fruit season apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on the streetcorner . . . . for milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in queue long hours in the chill rain . coming home from an allnight meeting i have seen the kvost tail beginning to form before dawn mostly women some with babies in their arms . . . . carlyle in his french revolution has described the french people as distinguished above all others by their faculty of standing in queue . russia had accustomed herself to the practice begun in the reign of nicholas the blessed as long ago as 1915 and from then continued intermittently until the summer of 1917 when it settled down as the regular order of things . think of the poorlyclad people standing on the ironwhite streets of petrograd whole days in the russian winter i have listened in the breadlines hearing the bitter acrid note of discontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculous goodnature of the russian crowd . . . . of course all the theatres were going every night including sundays . karsavina appeared in a new ballet at the marinsky all danceloving russia coming to see her . shaliapin was singing . at the alexandrinsky they were reviving meyerholds production of tolstoys death of ivan the terrible and at that performance i remember noticing a student of the imperial school of pages in his dress uniform who stood up correctly between the acts and faced the empty imperial box with its eagles all erased . . . . the krivoye zerkalo staged a sumptuous version of schnitzlers reigen . although the hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuated to moscow there were weekly exhibitions of paintings . hordes of the female intelligentzia went to hear lectures on art literature and the easy philosophies . it was a particularly active season for theosophists . and the salvation army admitted to russia for the first time in history plastered the walls with announcements of gospel meetings which amused and astounded russian audiences . . . . as in all such times the petty conventional life of the city went on ignoring the revolution as much as possible . the poets made versesbut not about the revolution . the realistic painters painted scenes from medival russian historyanything but the revolution . young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learn french and cultivate their voices and the gay young beautiful officers wore their goldtrimmed crimson bashliki and their elaborate caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies . the ladies of the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugarbox and half a loaf of bread in her muff and wished that the tsar were back or that the germans would come or anything that would solve the servant problem . . . . the daughter of a friend of mine came home one afternoon in hysterics because the woman streetcar conductor had called her comrade all around them great russia was in travail bearing a new world . the servants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing were getting independent . a pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles and as wages averaged about thirtyfive rubles a month the servants refused to stand in queue and wear out their shoes . but more than that . in the new russia every man and woman could vote there were workingclass newspapers saying new and startling things there were the soviets and there were the unions . the izvoshtchiki cabdrivers had a union they were also represented in the petrograd soviet . the waiters and hotel servants were organised and refused tips . on the walls of restaurants they put up signs which read no tips taken here or just because a man has to make his living waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him a tip at the front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers and learned selfgovernment through their committees . in the factories those unique russian organisations the factoryshop committees gained experience and strength and a realisation of see notes and explanations their historical mission by combat with the old order . all russia was learning to read and readingpolitics economics historybecause the people wanted to know . . . . in every city in most towns along the front each political faction had its newspapersometimes several . hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands of organisations and poured into the armies the villages the factories the streets . the thirst for education so long thwarted burst with the revolution into a frenzy of expression . from smolny institute alone the first six months went out every day tons carloads trainloads of literature saturating the land . russia absorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water insatiable . and it was not fables falsified history diluted religion and the cheap fiction that corruptsbut social and economic theories philosophy the works of tolstoy gogol and gorky . . . . then the talk beside which carlyles flood of french speech was a mere trickle . lectures debates speechesin theatres circuses schoolhouses clubs soviet meetingrooms union headquarters barracks . . . . meetings in the trenches at the front in village squares factories . . . . what a marvellous sight to see putilovsky zavod the putilov factory pour out its forty thousand to listen to social democrats socialist revolutionaries anarchists anybody whatever they had to say as long as they would talk for months in petrograd and all over russia every streetcorner was a public tribune . in railway trains streetcars always the spurting up of impromptu debate everywhere . . . . and the allrussian conferences and congresses drawing together the men of two continentsconventions of soviets of cooperatives zemstvos nationalities priests peasants political parties the see notes and explanations democratic conference the moscow conference the council of the russian republic . there were always three or four conventions going on in petrograd . at every meeting attempts to limit the time of speakers voted down and every man free to express the thought that was in him . . . . we came down to the front of the twelfth army back of riga where gaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches and when they saw us they started up with their pinched faces and the flesh showing blue through their torn clothing demanding eagerly did you bring anything to read what though the outward and visible signs of change were many what though the statue of catharine the great before the alexandrinsky theatre bore a little red flag in its hand and otherssomewhat fadedfloated from all public buildings and the imperial monograms and eagles were either torn down or covered up and in place of the fierce gorodovoye city police a mildmannered and unarmed citizen militia patrolled the streetsstill there were many quaint anachronisms . for example peter the greats tabel o rangovtable of rankswhich he rivetted upon russia with an iron hand still held sway . almost everybody from the schoolboy up wore his prescribed uniform with the insignia of the emperor on button and shoulderstrap . along about five oclock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued old gentlemen in uniform with portfolios going home from work in the huge barracklike ministries or government institutions calculating perhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advance them to the coveted tchin rank of collegiate assessor or privy councillor with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension and possibly the cross of st . anne . . . . there is the story of senator sokolov who in full tide of revolution came to a meeting of the senate one day in civilian clothes and was not admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of the tsars service it was against this background of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration that the pageant of the rising of the russian masses unrolled . . . . chapter ii the coming storm in september general kornilov marched on petrograd to make himself military dictator of russia . behind him was suddenly revealed the mailed fist of the bourgeoisie boldly attempting to crush the revolution . some of the socialist ministers were implicated even kerensky was under suspicion . see app . ii sect . 1 savinkov summoned to explain to the central committee of his party the socialist revolutionaries refused and was expelled . kornilov was arrested by the soldiers committees . generals were dismissed ministers suspended from their functions and the cabinet fell . kerensky tried to form a new government including the cadets party of the bourgeoisie . his party the socialist revolutionaries ordered him to exclude the cadets . kerensky declined to obey and threatened to resign from the cabinet if the socialists insisted . however popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did not dare oppose it and a temporary directorate of five of the old ministers with kerensky at the head assumed the power until the question should be settled . the kornilov affair drew together all the socialist groupsmoderates as well as revolutionistsin a passionate impulse of selfdefence . there must be no more kornilovs . a new government must be created responsible to the elements supporting the revolution . so the tsayeekah invited the popular organisations to send delegates to a democratic conference which should meet at petrograd in september . in the tsayeekah three factions immediately appeared . the bolsheviki demanded that the allrussian congress of soviets be summoned and that they take over the power . the centre socialist revolutionaries led by tchernov joined with the left socialist revolutionaries led by kamkov and spiridonova the mensheviki internationalists under martov and the centre mensheviki see notes and explanations . represented by bogdanov and skobeliev in demanding a purely socialist government . tseretelli dan and lieber at the head of the right wing mensheviki and the right socialist revolutionaries under avksentiev and gotz insisted that the propertied classes must be represented in the new government . almost immediately the bolsheviki won a majority in the petrograd soviet and the soviets of moscow kiev odessa and other cities followed suit . alarmed the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries in control of the tsayeekah decided that after all they feared the danger of kornilov less than the danger of lenin . they revised the plan of representation in the democratic conference see app . ii sect . 2 admitting more delegates from the cooperative societies and other conservative bodies . even this packed assembly at first voted for a coalition government without the cadets . only kerenskys open threat of resignation and the alarming cries of the moderate socialists that the republic is in danger persuaded the conference by a small majority to declare in favour of the principle of coalition with the bourgeoisie and to sanction the establishment of a sort of consultative parliament without any legislative power called the provisional council of the russian republic . in the new ministry the propertied classes practically controlled and in the council of the russian republic they occupied a disproportionate number of seats . the fact is that the tsayeekah no longer represented the rank and file of the soviets and had illegally refused to call another allrussian congress of soviets due in september . it had no intention of calling this congress or of allowing it to be called . its official organ izviestia news began to hint that the function of the soviets was nearly at an end see app . ii sect . 3 and that they might soon be dissolved . . . at this time too the new government announced as part of its policy the liquidation of irresponsible organisationsi .e . the soviets . the bolsheviki responded by summoning the allrussian soviets to meet at petrograd on november 2 and take over the government of russia . at the same time they withdrew from the council of the russian republic stating that they would not participate in a government of treason to the people . see app . ii sect . 4 the withdrawal of the bolsheviki however did not bring tranquillity to the illfated council . the propertied classes now in a position of power became arrogant . the cadets declared that the government had no legal right to declare russia a republic . they demanded stern measures in the army and navy to destroy the soldiers and sailors committees and denounced the soviets . on the other side of the chamber the mensheviki internationalists and the left socialist revolutionaries advocated immediate peace land to the peasants and workers control of industrypractically the bolshevik programme . i heard martovs speech in answer to the cadets . stooped over the desk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was and speaking in a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard he shook his finger toward the right benches you call us defeatists but the real defeatists are those who wait for a more propitious moment to conclude peace insist upon postponing peace until later until nothing is left of the russian army until russia becomes the subject of bargaining between the different imperialist groups . . . . you are trying to impose upon the russian people a policy dictated by the interests of the bourgeoisie . the question of peace should be raised without delay . . . . you will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whom you call german agents of those zimmerwaldists who in all the members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of the socialists of europe socalled because of their participation in the international conference held at zimmerwald switzerland in 1915 lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of the democratic masses . . . . between these two groups the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries wavered irresistibly forced to the left by the pressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses . deep hostility divided the chamber into irreconcilable groups . this was the situation when the longawaited announcement of the allied conference in paris brought up the burning question of foreign policy . . . . theoretically all socialist parties in russia were in favour of the earliest possible peace on democratic terms . as long ago as may 1917 the petrograd soviet then under control of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionarieshad proclaimed the famous russian peaceconditions . they had demanded that the allies hold a conference to discuss waraims . this conference had been promised for august then postponed until september then until october and now it was fixed for november 10th . the provisional government suggested two representativesgeneral alexeyev reactionary military man and terestchenko minister of foreign affairs . the soviets chose skobeliev to speak for them and drew up a manifesto the famous nakaz see app . ii sect . 5 instructions . the provisional government objected to skobeliev and his nakaz the allied ambassadors protested and finally bonar law in the british house of commons in answer to a question responded coldly as far as i know the paris conference will not discuss the aims of the war at all but only the methods of conducting it . . . . at this the conservative russian press was jubilant and the bolsheviki cried see where the compromising tactics of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries have led them along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in russias armies stirred like the sea rising pouring into the capital their hundreds upon hundreds of delegations crying peace peace i went across the river to the cirque moderne to one of the great popular meetings which occurred all over the city more numerous night after night . the bare gloomy amphitheatre lit by five tiny lights hanging from a thin wire was packed from the ring up the steep sweep of grimy benches to the very roofsoldiers sailors workmen women all listening as if their lives depended upon it . a soldier was speakingfrom the five hundred and fortyeight division wherever and whatever that was comrades he cried and there was real anguish in his drawn face and despairing gestures . the people at the top are always calling upon us to sacrifice more sacrifice more while those who have everything are left unmolested . we are at war with germany . would we invite german generals to serve on our staff well were at war with the capitalists too and yet we invite them into our government . . . . the soldier says show me what i am fighting for . is it constantinople or is it free russia is it the democracy or is it the capitalist plunderers if you can prove to me that i am defending the revolution then ill go out and fight without capital punishment to force me . when the land belongs to the peasants and the factories to the workers and the power to the soviets then well know we have something to fight for and well fight for it in the barracks the factories on the streetcorners end less soldier speakers all clamouring for an end to the war declaring that if the government did not make an energetic effort to get peace the army would leave the trenches and go home . the spokesman for the eighth army we are weak we have only a few men left in each company . they must give us food and boots and reinforcements or soon there will be left only empty trenches . peace or supplies . . . either let the government end the war or support the army . . . . for the fortysixth siberian artillery the officers will not work with our committees they betray us to the enemy they apply the death penalty to our agitators and the counterrevolutionary government supports them . we thought that the revolution would bring peace . but now the government forbids us even to talk of such things and at the same time doesnt give us enough food to live on or enough ammunition to fight with . . . . from europe came rumours of peace at the expense of russia . see app . ii sect . 6 . . . news of the treatment of russian troops in france added to the discontent . the first brigade had tried to replace its officers with soldiers committees like their comrades at home and had refused an order to go to salonika demanding to be sent to russia . they had been surrounded and starved and then fired on by artillery and many killed . see app . ii sect . 7 . . . on october 29th i went to the whitemarble and crimson hall of the marinsky palace where the council of the republic sat to hear terestchenkos declaration of the governments foreign policy awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peacethirsty and exhausted land . a tall impeccablydressed young man with a smooth face and high cheekbones suavely reading his careful noncommittal speech . see app . ii sect . 8 nothing . . . . only the same platitudes about crushing german militarism with the help of the alliesabout the state interests of russia about the embarrassment caused by skobelievs nakaz . he ended with the keynote russia is a great power . russia will remain a great power whatever happens . we must all defend her we must show that we are defenders of a great ideal and children of a great power . nobody was satisfied . the reactionaries wanted a strong imperialist policy the democratic parties wanted an assurance that the government would press for peace . . . . i reproduce an editorial in rabotchi i soldat worker and soldier organ of the bolshevik petrograd soviet the governments answer to the trenches the most taciturn of our ministers mr . terestchenko has actually told the trenches the following 1 . we are closely united with our allies . not with the peoples but with the governments . 2 . there is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility or impossibility of a winter campaign . that will be decided by the governments of our allies . 3 . the 1st of july offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair . he did not mention the consequences . 4 . it is not true that our allies do not care about us . the minister has in his possession very important declarations . declarations what about deeds what about the behaviour of the british fleet see app . ii sect . 9 the parleying of the british king with exiled counterrevolutionary general gurko the minister did not mention all this . 5 . the nakaz to skobeliev is bad the allies dont like it and the russian diplomats dont like it . in the allied conference we must all speak one language . and is that all that is all . what is the way out the solution is faith in the allies and in terestchenko . when will peace come when the allies permit . that is how the government replied to the trenches about peace now in the background of russian politics began to form the vague outlines of a sinister powerthe cossacks . novaya zhizn new life gorkys paper called attention to their activities at the beginning of the revolution the cossacks refused to shoot down the people . when kornilov marched on petrograd they refused to follow him . from passive loyalty to the revolution the cossacks have passed to an active political offensive against it . from the background of the revolution they have suddenly advanced to the front of the stage . . . . kaledin ataman of the don cossacks had been dismissed by the provisional government for his complicity in the kornilov affair . he flatly refused to resign and surrounded by three immense cossack armies lay at novotcherkask plotting and menacing . so great was his power that the government was forced to ignore his insubordination . more than that it was compelled formally to recognise the council of the union of cossack armies and to declare illegal the newlyformed cossack section of the soviets . . . . in the first part of october a cossack delegation called upon kerensky arrogantly insisting that the charges against kaledin be dropped and reproaching the ministerpresident for yielding to the soviets . kerensky agreed to let kaledin alone and then is reported to have said in the eyes of the soviet leaders i am a despot and a tyrant . . . . as for the provisional government not only does it not depend upon the soviets but it considers it regrettable that they exist at all . at the same time another cossack mission called upon the british ambassador treating with him boldly as representatives of the free cossack people . in the don something very like a cossack republic had been established . the kuban declared itself an independent cossack state . the soviets of rostovondon and yekaterinburg were dispersed by armed cossacks and the headquarters of the coal miners union at kharkov raided . in all its manifestations the cossack movement was antisocialist and militaristic . its leaders were nobles and great landowners like kaledin kornilov generals dutov karaulov and bardizhe and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers of moscow . . . . old russia was rapidly breaking up . in ukraine in finland poland white russia the nationalist movements gathered strength and became bolder . the local governments controlled by the propertied classes claimed autonomy refusing to obey orders from petrograd . at helsingfors the finnish senate declined to loan money to the provisional government declared finland autonomous and demanded the withdrawal of russian troops . the bourgeois rada at kiev extended the boundaries of ukraine until they included all the richest agricultural lands of south russia as far east as the urals and began the formation of a national army . premier vinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with germanyand the provisional government was helpless . siberia the caucasus demanded separate constituent assemblies . and in all these countries there was the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities and the local soviets of workers and soldiers deputies . . . . conditions were daily more chaotic . hundreds of thousands of soldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast aimless tides over the face of the land . the peasants of tambov and tver governments tired of waiting for the land exasperated by the repressive measures of the government were burning manorhouses and massacring landowners . immense strikes and lockouts convulsed moscow odessa and the coalmines of the don . transportation was paralysed the army was starving and in the big cities there was no bread . the government torn between the democratic and reactionary factions could do nothing when forced to act it always supported the interests of the propertied classes . cossacks were sent to restore order among the peasants to break the strikes . in tashkent government authorities suppressed the soviet . in petrograd the economic council established to rebuild the shattered economic life of the country came to a deadlock between the opposing forces of capital and labour and was dissolved by kerensky . the old rgime military men backed by cadets demanded that harsh measures be adopted to restore discipline in the army and the navy . in vain admiral verderevsky the venerable minister of marine and general verkhovsky minister of war insisted that only a new voluntary democratic discipline based on cooperation with the soldiers and sailors committees could save the army and navy . their recommendations were ignored . the reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger . the trial of kornilov was coming on . more and more openly the bourgeois press defended him speaking of him as the great russian patriot . burtzevs paper obshtchee dielo common cause called for a dictatorship of kornilov kaledin and kerensky i had a talk with burtzev one day in the press gallery of the council of the republic . a small stooped figure with a wrinkled face eyes nearsighted behind thick glasses untidy hair and beard streaked with grey . mark my words young man what russia needs is a strong man . we should get our minds off the revolution now and concentrate on the germans . bunglers bunglers to defeat kornilov and back of the bunglers are the german agents . kornilov should have won . . . . on the extreme right the organs of the scarcelyveiled monarchists purishkevitchs narodny tribun peoples tribune novaya rus new russia and zhivoye slovo living word openly advocated the extermination of the revolutionary democracy . . . . on the 23rd of october occurred the naval battle with a german squadron in the gulf of riga . on the pretext that petrograd was in danger the provisional government drew up plans for evacuating the capital . first the great munitions works were to go distributed widely throughout russia and then the government itself was to move to moscow . instantly the bolsheviki began to cry out that the government was abandoning the red capital in order to weaken the revolution . riga had been sold to the germans now petrograd was being betrayed the bourgeois press was joyful . at moscow said the cadet paper ryetch speech the government can pursue its work in a tranquil atmosphere without being interfered with by anarchists . rodzianko leader of the right wing of the cadet party declared in utro rossii the morning of russia that the taking of petrograd by the germans would be a blessing because it would destroy the soviets and get rid of the revolutionary baltic fleet petrograd is in danger he wrote . i say to myself let god take care of petrograd . they fear that if petrograd is lost the central revolutionary organisations will be destroyed . to that i answer that i rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed for they will bring nothing but disaster upon russia . . . . with the taking of petrograd the baltic fleet will also be destroyed . . . . but there will be nothing to regret most of the battleships are completely demoralised . . . . in the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuation was repudiated . meanwhile the congress of soviets loomed over russia like a thundercloud shot through with lightnings . it was opposed not only by the government but by all the moderate socialists . the central army and fleet committees the central committees of some of the trade unions the peasants soviets but most of all the tsayeekah itself spared no pains to prevent the meeting . izviestia and golos soldata voice of the soldier newspapers founded by the petrograd soviet but now in the hands of the tsayeekah fiercely assailed it as did the entire artillery of the socialist revolutionary party press dielo naroda peoples cause and volia naroda peoples will . delegates were sent through the country messages flashed by wire to committees in charge of local soviets to army committees instructing them to halt or delay elections to the congress . solemn public resolutions against the congress declarations that the democracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of the constituent assembly representatives from the front from the union of zemstvos the peasants union union of cossack armies union of officers knights of st . george death battalions protesting . . . . see notes and explanations . the council of the russian republic was one chorus of disapproval . the entire machinery set up by the russian revolution of march functioned to block the congress of soviets . . . . on the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariatthe workmen common soldiers and poor peasants . many local soviets were already bolshevik then there were the organisations of the industrial workers the fabritchnozavodskiye comitieti factoryshop committees and the insurgent army and fleet organisations . in some places the people prevented from electing their regular soviet delegates held rump meetings and chose one of their number to go to petrograd . in others they smashed the old obstructionist committees and formed new ones . a groundswell of revolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardening on the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months . only an spontaneous massmovement could bring about the allrussian congress of soviets . . . . day after day the bolshevik orators toured the barracks and factories violently denouncing this government of civil war . one sunday we went on a topheavy steam tram that lumbered through oceans of mud between stark factories and immense churches to obukhovsky zavod a government munitionsplant out on the schlsselburg prospekt . the meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a huge unfinished building ten thousand blackclothed men and women packed around a scaffolding draped in red people heaped on piles of lumber and bricks perched high upon shadowy girders intent and thundervoiced . through the dull heavy sky now and again burst the sun flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon the mass of simple faces upturned to us . lunatcharsky a slight studentlike figure with the sensitive face of an artist was telling why the power must be taken by the soviets . nothing else could guarantee the revolution against its enemies who were deliberately ruining the country ruining the army creating opportunities for a new konilov . a soldier from the rumanian front thin tragical and fierce cried comrades we are starving at the front we are stiff with cold . we are dying for no reason . i ask the american comrades to carry word to america that the russians will never give up their revolution until they die . we will hold the fort with all our strength until the peoples of the world rise and help us tell the american workers to rise and fight for the social revolution then came petrovsky slight slowvoiced implacable now is the time for deeds not words . the economic situation is bad but we must get used to it . they are trying to starve us and freeze us . they are trying to provoke us . but let them know that they can go too farthat if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisations of the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the face of the earth the bolshevik press suddenly expanded . besides the two party papers rabotchi put and soldat soldier there appeared a new paper for the peasants derevenskaya byednota village poorest poured out in a daily halfmillion edition and on october 17th rabotchi i soldat . its leading article summed up the bolshevik point of view the fourth years campaign will mean the annihilation of the army and the country . . . . there is danger for the safety of petrograd . . . . counterrevolutionists rejoice in the peoples misfortunes . . . . the peasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion the landlords and government authorities massacre them with punitive expeditions factories and mines are closing down workmen are threatened with starvation . . . . the bourgeoisie and its generals want to restore a blind discipline in the army . . . . supported by the bourgeoisie the kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break up the meeting of the constituent assembly . . . . the kerensky government is against the people . he will destroy the country . . . . this paper stands for the people and by the peoplethe poor classes workers soldiers and peasants . the people can only be saved by the completion of the revolution . . . and for this purpose the full power must be in the hands of the soviets . . . . this paper advocates the following all power to the sovietsboth in the capital and in the provinces . immediate truce on all fronts . an honest peace between peoples . landlord estateswithout compensationto the peasants . workers control over industrial production . a faithfully and honestly elected constituent assembly . it is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that same paperthe organ of those bolsheviki so well known to the world as german agents the german kaiser covered with the blood of millions of dead people wants to push his army against petrograd . let us call to the german workmen soldiers and peasants who want peace not less than we do to . . . stand up against this damned war this can be done only by a revolutionary government which would speak really for the workmen soldiers and peasants of russia and would appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the german troops fill the german trenches with proclamations in the german language . . . . our airmen would spread these proclamations all over germany . . . . in the council of the republic the gulf between the two sides of the chamber deepened day by day . the propertied classes cried karelin for the left socialist revolutionaries want to exploit the revolutionary machine of the state to bind russia to the warchariot of the allies the revolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy . . . . old nicholas tchaikovsky representing the populist socialists spoke against giving the land to the peasants and took the side of the cadets we must have immediately strong discipline in the army . . . . since the beginning of the war i have not ceased to insist that it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms in wartime . we are committing that crime and yet i am not the enemy of these reforms because i am a socialist . cries from the left we dont believe you mighty applause from the right . . . . adzhemov for the cadets declared that there was no necessity to tell the army what it was fighting for since every soldier ought to realise that the first task was to drive the enemy from russian territory . kerensky himself came twice to plead passionately for national unity once bursting into tears at the end . the assembly heard him coldly interrupting with ironical remarks . smolny institute headquarters of the tsayeekah and of the petrograd soviet lay miles out on the edge of the city beside the wide neva . i went there on a streetcar moving snaillike with a groaning noise through the cobbled muddy streets and jammed with people . at the end of the line rose the graceful smokeblue cupolas of smolny convent outlined in dull gold beautiful and beside it the great barracks like faade of smolny institute two hundred yards long and three lofty stories high the imperial arms carved hugely in stone still insolent over the entrance . . . . under the old rgime a famous conventschool for the daughters of the russian nobility patronised by the tsarina herself the institute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations of workers and soldiers . within were more than a hundred huge rooms white and bare on their doors enamelled plaques still informing the passerby that within was ladies classroom number 4 or teachers bureau but over these hung crudelylettered signs evidence of the vitality of the new order central committee of the petrograd soviet and tsayeekah and bureau of foreign affairs union of socialist soldiers central committee of the allrussian trade unions factoryshop committees central army committee and the central offices and caucusrooms of the political parties . . . . the long vaulted corridors lit by rare electric lights were thronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen some bent under the weight of huge bundles of newspapers proclamations printed propaganda of all sorts . the sound of their heavy boots made a deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor . . . . signs were posted up everywhere comrades for the sake of your health preserve cleanliness long tables stood at the head of the stairs on every floor and on the landings heaped with pamphlets and the literature of the different political parties for sale . . . . the spacious lowceilinged refectory downstairs was still a diningroom . for two rubles i bought a ticket entitling me to dinner and stood in line with a thousand others waiting to get to the long servingtables where twenty men and women were ladling from immense cauldrons cabbage soup hunks of meat and piles of kasha slabs of black bread . five kopeks paid for tea in a tin cup . from a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon . . . . the benches along the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians wolfing their food plotting shouting rough jokes across the room . . . . graphic page33 text of placard in russian translation follows comrades for the sake of your health preserve cleanliness . upstairs was another eatingplace reserved for the tsayeekah though every one went there . here could be had bread thickly buttered and endless glasses of tea . . . . in the south wing on the second floor was the great hall of meetings the former ballroom of the institute . a lofty white room lighted by glazedwhite chandeliers holding hundreds of ornate electric bulbs and divided by two rows of massive columns at one end a dais flanked with two tall manybranched light standards and a gold frame behind from which the imperial portrait had been cut . here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military and ecclesiastical uniforms a setting for grand duchesses . . . . just across the hall outside was the office of the credentials committee for the congress of soviets . i stood there watching the new delegates come inburly bearded soldiers workmen in black blouses a few longhaired peasants . the girl in chargea member of plekhanovs yedinstvo groupsmiled contemptuously . these are see notes and explanations very different people from the delegates to the first siezd congress she remarked . see how rough and ignorant they look the dark people . . . . it was true the depths of russia had been stirred and it was the bottom which came uppermost now . the credentials committee appointed by the old tsayeekah was challenging delegate after delegate on the ground that they had been illegally elected . karakhan member of the bolshevik central committee simply grinned . never mind he said when the time comes well see that you get your seats . . . . rabotchi i soldat said the attention of delegates to the new allrussian congress is called to attempts of certain members of the organising committee to break up the congress by asserting that it will not take place and that delegates had better leave petrograd . . . . pay no attention to these lies . . . . great days are coming . . . . it was evident that a quorum would not come together by november 2 so the opening of the congress was postponed to the 7th . but the whole country was now aroused and the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries realising that they were defeated suddenly changed their tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincial organisations to elect as many moderate socialist delegates as possible . at the same time the executive committee of the peasants soviets issued an emergency call for a peasants congress to meet december 13th and offset whatever action the workers and soldiers might take . . . what would the bolsheviki do rumours ran through the city that there would be an armed demonstration a vystuplenniecoming out of the workers and soldiers . the bourgeois and reactionary press prophesied insurrection and urged the government to arrest the petrograd soviet or at least to prevent the meeting of the congress . such sheets as novaya rus advocated a general bolshevik massacre . gorkys paper novaya zhizn agreed with the bolsheviki that the reactionaries were attempting to destroy the revolution and that if necessary they must be resisted by force of arms but all the parties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front . as long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces so long as the resistance to its influence is still strong there is no advantage in passing to the attack . but if the hostile elements appeal to force then the revolutionary democracy should enter the battle to seize the power and it will be sustained by the most profound strata of the people . . . . gorky pointed out that both reactionary and government newspapers were inciting the bolsheviki to violence . an insurrection however would prepare the way for a new kornilov . he urged the bolsheviki to deny the rumours . potressov in the menshevik dien day published a sensational story accompanied by a map which professed to reveal the secret bolshevik plan of campaign . as if by magic the walls were covered with warnings see app . ii sect . 10 proclamations appeals from the central committees of the moderate and conservative factions and the tsayeekah denouncing any demonstrations imploring the workers and soldiers not to listen to agitators . for instance this from the military section of the socialist revolutionary party again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended vystuplennie . what is the source of these rumours what organisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection the bolsheviki to a question addressed to them in the tsayeekah denied that they have anything to do with it . . . . but these rumours themselves carry with them a great danger . it may easily happen that not taking into consideration the state of mind of the majority of the workers soldiers and peasants individual hotheads will call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets inciting them to an uprising . . . . in this fearful time through which revolutionary russia is passing any insurrection can easily turn into civil war and there can result from it the destruction of all organisations of the proletariat built up with so much labour . . . . the counterrevolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage of this insurrection to destroy the revolution open the front to wilhelm and wreck the constituent assembly . . . . stick stubbornly to your posts do not come out on october 28th in the corridors of smolny i spoke with kameniev a little man with a reddish pointed beard and gallic gestures . he was not at all sure that enough delegates would come . if there is a congress he said it will represent the overwhelming sentiment of the people . if the majority is bolshevik as i think it will be we shall demand that the power be given to the soviets and the provisional government must resign . . . . volodarsky a tall pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion was more definite . the lieberdans and the other compromisers are sabotaging the congress . if they succeed in preventing its meetingwell then we are realists enough not to depend on that under date of october 29th i find entered in my notebook the following items culled from the newspapers of the day moghilev general staff headquarters . concentration here of loyal guard regiments the savage division cossacks and death battalions . the yunkers of the officers schools of pavlovsk tsarskoye selo and peterhof ordered by the government to be ready to come to petrograd . oranienbaum yunkers arrive in the city . part of the armoured car division of the petrograd garrism stationed in the winter palace . upon orders signed by trotzky several thousand rifles delivered by the government arms factory at sestroretzk to delegates of the petrograd workmen . at a meeting of the city militia of the lower liteiny quarter a resolution demanding that all power be given to the soviets . this is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days when everybody knew that something was going to happen but nobody knew just what . at a meeting of the petrograd soviet in smolny the night of october 30th trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that the soviet contemplated armed insurention as an attempt of the reactionaries to discredit and wreck the congress of soviets . . . . the petrograd soviet he declared had not ordered any uystuplennie . if it is necessary we shall do so and we will be supported by the petrogruad garrison . . . . they the government are preparing a counterrevolution and we shall answer with an offensive which will be merciless and decisive . it is true that the petrograd soviet had not ordered a demonstration but the central committee of the bolshevik party was considering the question of insurrection . all night long the 23d they met . there were present all the party intellectuals the leadersand delegates of the petrograd workers and garrison . alone of the intellectuals lenin and trotzky stood for insurrection . even urrection . even the military men opposed it . a vote was taken . insurrection was defeated then arose a rough workman his face convulsed with rage . i speak for the petrograd proletariat he said harshly . we are in favour of insurrection . have it your own way but i tell you now that if you allow the soviets to be destroyed were through with you some soldiers joined him . . . . and after that they voted againinsurrection won . . . . however the right wing of the bolsheviki led by riazanov kameniev and zinoviev continued to campaign against an armed rising . on the morning of october 31st appeared in rabotchi put the first instalment of lenins letter to the comrades see app . ii sect . 11 one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda the world has ever seen . in it lenin seriously presented the arguments in favour of insurrection taking as text the objections of kameniev and riazonov . either we must abandon our slogan all power to the soviets he wrote or else we must make an insurrection . there is no middle course . . . . that same afternoon paul miliukov leader of the cadets made a brilliant bitter speech see app . ii sect . 12 in the council of the republic branding the skobeliev nakaz as progerman declaring that the revolutionary democracy was destroying russia sneering at terestchenko and openly declaring that he preferred german diplomacy to russian . . . . the left benches were one roaring tumult all through . . . . on its part the government could not ignore the significance of the success of the bolshevik propaganda . on the 29th joint commission of the government and the council of the republic hastily drew up two laws one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants and the other for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace . the next day kerensky suspended capital punishment in the army . that same afternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of the new commission for strengthening the republican rgime and fighting against anarchy and counterrevolutionof which history shows not the slightest further trace . . . . the following morning with two other correspondents i interviewed kerensky see app . ii sect . 13the last time he received journalists . the russian people he said bitterly are suffering from economic fatigueand from disillusionment with the allies the world thinks that the russian revolution is at an end . do not be mistaken . the russian revolution is just beginning . . . . words more prophetic perhaps than he knew . stormy was the allnight meeting of the petrograd soviet the 30th of october at which i was present . the moderate socialist intellectuals officers members of army committees the tsayeekah were there in force . against them rose up workmen peasants and common soldiers passionate and simple . a peasant told of the disorders in tver which he said were caused by the arrest of the land committees . this kerensky is nothing but a shield to the pomieshtchiki landowners he cried . they know that at the constituent assembly we will take the land anyway so they are trying to destroy the constituent assembly a machinist from the putilov works described how the superintendents were closing down the departments one by one on the pretext that there was no fuel or raw materials . the factoryshop committee he declared had discovered huge hidden supplies . it is a provocatzia said he . they want to starve usor drive us to violence among the soldiers one began comrades i bring you greetings from the place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches then arose a tall gaunt young soldier with flashing eyes met with a roar of welcome . it was tchudnovsky reported killed in the july fighting and now risen from the dead . the soldier masses no longer trust their officers . even the army committees who refused to call a meeting of our soviet betrayed us . . . . the masses of the soldiers want the constituent assembly to be held exactly when it was called for and those who dare to postpone it will be cursedand not only platonic curses either for the army has guns too . . . . he told of the electoral campaign for the constituent now raging in the fifth army . the officers and especially the mensheviki and the socialist revolutionaries are trying deliberately to cripple the bolsheviki . our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches . our speakers are arrested why dont you speak about the lack of bread shouted another soldier . man shall not live by bread alone answered tchudnovsky sternly . . . . followed him an officer delegate from the vitebsk soviet a menshevik oboronetz . it isnt the question of who has the power . the trouble is not with the government but with the war . . . . and the war must be won before any change at this hoots and ironical cheers . these bolshevik agitators are demagogues the hall rocked with laughter . let us for a moment forget the class struggle but he got no farther . a voice yelled dont you wish we would petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days . in the factories the committerooms were filled with stacks of rifles couriers came and went the red guard drilled . . . . in all the see notes and explanations barracks meetings every night and all day long interminable hot arguments . on the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomy evening pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the nevsky fighting for the newspapers . . . . holdups increased to such an extent that it was dangerous to walk down side streets . . . . on the sadovaya one afternoon i saw a crowd of several hundred people beat and trample to death a soldier caught stealing . . . . mysterious individuals circulated around the shivering women who waited in queue long cold hours for bread and milk whispering that the jews had cornered the food supplyand that while the people starved the soviet members lived luxuriously . . . . at smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates demanding everybodys pass . the committeerooms buzzed and hummed all day and all night hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on the floor wherever they could find room . upstairs in the great hall a thousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the petrograd soviet . . . . gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn with champagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles . in the centre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furs walked up and down crowded the cafs . . . . monarchist plots german spies smugglers hatching schemes . . . . and in the rain the bitter chill the great throbbing city under grey skies rushing faster and faster towardwhat chapter iii on the eve in the relations of a weak government and a rebellious people there comes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates the masses and every refusal to act excites their contempt . . . . the proposal to abandon petrograd raised a hurricane kerenskys public denial that the government had any such intention was met with hoots of derision . pinned to the wall by the pressure of the revolution cried rabotchi put the government of provisional bourgeois tries to get free by giving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing from petrograd and that it didnt wish to surrender the capital . . . . in kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised adopting the preamble of the i . w . w . constitution the working class and the employing class have nothing in common . dispersed by cossacks some were locked out by the mineowners and the rest declared a general strike . minister of commerce and industry konovalov appointed his assistant orlov with plenary powers to settle the trouble . orlov was hated by the miners . but the tsayeekah not only supported his appointment but refused to demand that the cossacks be recalled from the don basin . . . . this was followed by the dispersal of the soviet at kaluga . the bolsheviki having secured a majority in the soviet set free some political prisoners . with the sanction of the government commissar the municipal duma called in troops from minsk and bombarded the soviet headquarters with artillery . the bolsheviki yielded but as they left the building cossacks attacked them crying this is what well do to all the other bolshevik soviets including those of moscow and petrograd this incident sent a wave of panic rage throughout russia . . . . in petrograd was ending a regional congress of soviets of the north presided over by the bolshevik krylenko . by an immense majority it resolved that all power should be assumed by the allrussian congress and concluded by greeting the bolsheviki in prison bidding them rejoice for the hour of their liberation was at hand . at the same time the first allrussian conference of factoryshop committees see app . iii sect . 1 declared emphatically for the soviets and continued significantly after liberating themselves politically from tsardom the workingclass wants to see the democratic rgime triumphant in the sphere of its productive activity . this is best expressed by workers control over industrial production which naturally arose in the atmosphere of economic decomposition created by the criminal policy of the dominating classes . . . . the union of railwaymen was demanding the resignation of liverovsky minister of ways and communications . . . . in the name of the tsayeekah skobeliev insisted that the nakaz be presented at the allied conference and formally protested against the sending of terestchenko to paris . terestchenko offered to resign . . . . general verkhovsky unable to accomplish his reorganisation of the army only came to cabinet meetings at long intervals . . . . on november 3d burtzevs obshtchee dielo came out with great headlines citizens save the fatherland i have just learned that yesterday at a meeting of the commission for national defence minister of war general verkhovsky one of the principal persons responsible for the fall of kornilov proposed to sign a separate peace independently of the allies . that is treason to russia terestchenko declared that the provisional government had not even examined verkhovskys proposition . you might think said terestchenko that we were in a madhouse the members of the commission were astounded at the generals words . general alexeyev wept . no it is not madness it is worse . it is direct treason to russia kerensky terestchenko and nekrassov must immediately answer us concerning the words of verkhovsky . citizens arise russia is being sold save her what verkhovsky really said was that the allies must be pressed to offer peace because the russian army could fight no longer . . . . both in russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous . verkhovsky was given indefinite leave of absence for illhealth and left the government . obshtchee dielo was suppressed . . . . sunday november 4th was designated as the day of the petrograd soviet with immense meetings planned all over the city ostensibly to raise money for the organisation and the press really to make a demonstration of strength . suddenly it was announced that on the same day the cossacks would hold a krestny khodprocession of the crossin honour of the ikon of 1612 through whose miraculous intervention napoleon had been driven from moscow . the atmosphere was electric a spark might kindle civil war . the petrograd soviet issued a manifesto headed brotherscossacks you cossacks are being incited against us workers and soldiers . this plan of cain is being put into operation by our common enemies the oppressors the privileged classesgenerals bankers landlords former officials former servants of the tsar . . . . we are hated by all grafters rich men princes nobles generals including your cossack generals . they are ready at any moment to destroy the petrograd soviet and crush the revolution . . . . on the 4th of november somebody is organising a cossack religious procession . it is a question of the free consciousness of every individual whether he will or will not take part in this procession . we do not interfere in this matter nor do we obstruct anybody . . . . however we warn you cossacks look out and see to it that under the pretext of a krestni khod your kaledins do not instigate you against workmen against soldiers . . . . the procession was hastily called off . . . . in the barracks and the workingclass quarters of the town the bolsheviki were preaching all power to the soviets and agents of the dark forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter the jews shopkeepers socialist leaders . . . . on one side the monarchist press inciting to bloody repressionon the other lenins great voice roaring insurrection . . . . we cannot wait any longer even the bourgeois press was uneasy . see app . iii sect . 2 birjevya viedomosti exchange gazette called the bolshevik propaganda an attack on the most elementary principles of societypersonal security and the respect for private property . graphic

begins . the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies addresses you . but it was the moderate socialist journals which were the most hostile . see app . iii sect . 3 the bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the revolution declared dielo naroda . said the menshevik dien the government ought to defend itself and defend us . plekhanovs paper yedinstvo unity see app . iii sect . 4 called the attention of the government to the fact that the petrograd workers were being armed and demanded stern measures against the bolsheviki . daily the government seemed to become more helpless . even the municipal administration broke down . the columns of the morning papers were filled with accounts of the most audacious robberies and murders and the criminals were unmolested . on the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night doing battle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they found them . on the first of november colonel polkovnikov military commander of petrograd issued a proclamation despite the difficult days through which the country is passing irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are still being spread around petrograd and from day to day robbery and disorder increase . this state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens and hinders the systematic work of the government and the municipal institutions . in full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before my country i command 1 . every military unit in accordance with special instructions and within the territory of its garrison to afford every assistance to the municipality to the commissars and to the militia in the guarding of government institutions . 2 . the organisation of patrols in cooperation with the district commander and the representatives of the city militia and the taking of measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters . 3 . the arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to armed demonstrations and massacres and their delivery to the headquarters of the second commander of the city . 4 . to suppress any armed demonstration or riot at its start with all armed forces at hand . 5 . to afford assistance to the commissars in preventing unwarranted searches in houses and unwarranted arrests . 6 . to report immediately all that happens in the district under charge to the staff of the petrograd military district . i call upon all army committees and organisations to afford their help to the commanders in fulfilment of the duties with which they are charged . in the council of the republic kerensky declared that the government was fully aware of the bolshevik preparations and had sufficient force to cope with any demonstration . see app . iii sect . 5 he accused novaya rus and robotchi put of both doing the same kind of subversive work . but owing to the absolute freedom of the press he added the government is not in a position to combat printed lies . . . . . declaring that these were two aspects of the same this was not quite candid . the provisional gevernment had suppressed bolshevik papers before in july and was planning to do so again . propaganda which had for its object the counterrevolution so ardently desired by the dark forces he went on i am a doomed man it doesnt matter what happens to me and i have the audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of the unbelievable provocation created in the city by the bolsheviki on november 2d only fifteen delegates to the congress of soviets had arrived . next day there were a hundred and the morning after that a hundred and seventyfive of whom one hundred and three were bolsheviki . . . . four hundred constituted a quorum and the congress was only three days off . . . . i spent a great deal of time at smolny . it was no longer easy to get in . double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates and once inside the front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in four at a time to be questioned as to their identity and their business . passes were given out and the pass system was changed every few hours for spies continually sneaked through . . . . graphic page49 russian pass

trotzky searched through his pockets but could find no pass . never mind he said finally . you know me . my name is trotzky . you havent got a pass answered the soldier stubbornly . you cannot go in . names dont mean anything to me . but i am the president of the petrograd soviet . well replied the soldier if youre as important a fellow as that you must at least have one little paper . trotzky was very patient . let me see the commandant he said . the soldier hesitated grumbling something about not wanting to disturb the commandant for every devil that came along . he beckoned finally to the soldier in command of the guard . trotzky explained matters to him . my name is trotzky he repeated . trotzky the other soldier scratched his head . ive heard the name somewhere he said at length . i guess its all right . you can go on in comrade . . . . in the corridor i met karakhan member of the bolshevik central committee who explained to me what the new government would be like . a loose organisation sensitive to the popular will as expressed through the soviets allowing local forces full play . at present the provisional government obstructs the action of the local democratic will just as the tsars government did . the initiative of the new society shall come from below . . . . the form of the government will be modelled on the constitution of the russian social democratic labour party . the new tsayeekah responsible to frequent meetings of the allrussian congress of soviets will be the parliament the various ministries will be headed by collegiacommitteesinstead of by ministers and will be directly responsible to the soviets . . . . on october 30th by appointment i went up to a small bare room in the attic of smolny to talk with trotzky . in the middle of the room he sat on a rough chair at a bare table . few questions from me were necessary he talked rapidly and steadily for more than an hour . the substance of his talk in his own words i give here the provisional government is absolutely powerless . the bourgeoisie is in control but this control is masked by a fictitious coalition with the oborontsi parties . now during the revolution one sees revolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land and all over the country in all the toiling classes the same disgust is evident . this domination by the bourgeoisie is only possible by means of civil war . the kornilov method is the only way by which the bourgeoisie can control . but it is force which the bourgeoisie lacks . . . . the army is with us . the conciliators and pacifists socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki have lost all authoritybecause the struggle between the peasants and the landlords between the workers and the employers between the soldiers and the officers has become more bitter more irreconcilable than ever . only by the concerted action of the popular mass only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship can the revolution be achieved and the people saved . . . . the soviets are the most perfect representatives of the peopleperfect in their revolutionary experience in their ideas and objects . based directly upon the army in the trenches the workers in the factories and the peasants in the fields they are the backbone of the revolution . there has been an attempt to create a power without the sovietsand only powerlessness has been created . counterrevolutionary schemes of all sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the council of the russian republic . the cadet party represents the counterrevolution militant . on the other side the soviets represent the cause of the people . between the two camps there are no groups of serious importance . . . . it is the lutte finale . the bourgeois counterrevolution organises all its forces and waits for the moment to attack us . our answer will be decisive . we will complete the work scarcely begun in march and advanced during the kornilov affair . . . . he went on to speak of the new governments foreign policy our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on all fronts and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peace terms . the quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlement depends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in europe . if we create here a government of the soviets that will be a powerful factor for immediate peace in europe for this government will address itself directly and immediately to all peoples over the heads of their governments proposing an armistice . at the moment of the conclusion of peace the pressure of the russian revolution will be in the direction of no annexations no indemnities the right of selfdetermination of peoples and a federated republic of europe . . . . at the end of this war i see europe recreated not by the diplomats but by the proletariat . the federated republic of europethe united states of europethat is what must be . national autonomy no longer suffices . economic evolution demands the abolition of national frontiers . if europe is to remain split into national groups then imperialism will recommence its work . only a federated republic of europe can give peace to the world . he smiledthat fine faintly ironical smile of his . but without the action of the european masses these ends cannot be realisednow . . . . now while everybody was waiting for the bolsheviki to appear suddenly on the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with white collars on the real insurrection took its way quite naturally and openly . the provisional government planned to send the petrograd garrison to the front . the petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men who had taken a prominent part in the revolution . it was they who had turned the tide in the great days of march created the soviets of soldiers deputies and hurled back kornilov from the gates of petrograd . now a large part of them were bolsheviki . when the provisional government talked of evacuating the city it was the petrograd garrison which answered if you are not capable of defending the capital conclude peace if you cannot conclude peace go away and make room for a peoples government which can do both . . . . it was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon the attitude of the petrograd garrison . the governments plan was to replace the garrison regiments with dependable troopscossacks death battalions . the army committees the moderate socialists and the tsayeekah supported the government . a widespread agitation was carried on at the front and in petrograd emphasizing the fact that for eight months the petrograd garrison had been leading an easy life in the barracks of the capital while their exhausted comrades in the trenches starved and died . naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrison regiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort for the hardships of a winter campaign . but there were other reasons why they refused to go . the petrograd soviet feared the governments intentions and from the front came hundreds of delegates chosen by the common soldiers crying it is true we need reinforcements but more important we must know that petrograd and the revolution are wellguarded . . . . do you hold the rear comrades and we will hold the front on october 25th behind closed doors the central committee of the petrograd soviet discussed the formation of a special military committee to decide the whole question . the next day a meeting of the soldiers section of the petrograd soviet elected a committee which immediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers and condemned the tsayeekah for opposing the congress of soviets . on the 29th in open session of the petrograd soviet trotzky proposed that the soviet formally sanction the military revolutionary committee . we ought he said to create our special organisation to march to battle and if necessary to die . . . . it was decided to send to the front two delegations one from the soviet and one from the garrison to confer with the soldiers committees and the general staff . at pskov the soviet delegates were met by general tcheremissov commander of the northern front with the curt declaration that he had ordered the petrograd garrison to the trenches and that was all . the garrison committee was not allowed to leave petrograd . . . . a delegation of the soldiers section of the petrograd soviet asked that a representative be admitted to the staff of the petrograd district . refused . the petrograd soviet demanded that no orders be issued without the approval of the soldiers section . refused . the delegates were roughly told we only recognise the tsayeekah . we do not recognise you if you break any laws we shall arrest you . on the 30th a meeting of representatives of all the petrograd regiments passed a resolution the petrograd garrison no longer recognises the provisional government . the petrograd soviet is our government . we will obey only the orders of the petrograd soviet through the military revolutionary committee . the local military units were ordered to wait for instructions from the soldiers section of the petrograd soviet . next day the tsayeekah summoned its own meeting composed largely of officers formed a committee to cooperate with the staff and detailed commissars in all quarters of the city . a great soldier meeting at smolny on the 3d resolved saluting the creation of the military revolutionary committee the petrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of the revolution . the garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionary proletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order in petrograd . every attempt at provocation on the part of the kornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance . now conscious of its power the military revolutionary committee peremptorily summoned the petrograd staff to submit to its control . to all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals or proclamations without the committees authorisation . armed commissars visited the kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms and ammunition halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which was being sent to novotcherkask headquarters of kaledin . . . . suddenly awake to the danger the government offered immunity if the committee would disband . too late . at midnight november 5th kerensky himself sent malevsky to offer the petrograd soviet representation on the staff . the military revolutionary committee accepted . an hour later general manikovsky acting minister of war countermanded the offer . . . . tuesday morning november 6th the city was thrown into excitement by the appearance of a placard signed military revolutionary committee attached to the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies . to the population of petrograd . citizens counterrevolution has raised its criminal head . the kornilovtsi are mobilising their forces in order to crush the allrussian congress of soviets and break the constituent assembly . at the same time the pogromists may attempt to call upon the people of petrograd for trouble and bloodshed . the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in the city against counterrevolutionary and pogrom attempts . the petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders . the population is invited to arrest hooligans and black hundred agitators and take them to the soviet commissars at the nearest barracks . at the first attempt of the dark forces to make trouble on the streets of petrograd whether robbery or fighting the criminals will be wiped off the face of the earth citizens we call upon you to maintain complete quiet and selfpossession . the cause of order and revolution is in strong hands . list of regiments where there are commissars of the military revolutionary committee . . . . on the 3rd the leaders of the bolsheviki had another historic meeting behind closed doors . notified by zalkind i waited in the corridor outside the door and volodarsky as he came out told me what was going on . lenin spoke november 6th will be too early . we must have an allrussian basis for the rising and on the 6th all the delegates to the congress will not have arrived . . . . on the other hand november 8th will be too late . by that time the congress will be organised and it is difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift decisive action . we must act on the 7th the day the congress meets so that we may say to it here is the power what are you going to do with it in a certain upstairs room sat a thinfaced longhaired individual once an officer in the armies of the tsar then revolutionist and exile a certain avseenko called antonov mathematician and chessplayer he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of the capital . on its side the government was preparing . inconspicuously certain of the most loyal regiments from widelyseparated divisions were ordered to petrograd . the yunker artillery was drawn into the winter palace . patrols of cossacks made their appearance in the streets for the first time since the july days . polkovnikov issued order after order threatening to repress all insubordination with the utmost energy . kishkin minister of public instruction the worsthated member of the cabinet was appointed special commissar to keep order in petrograd he named as assistants two men no less unpopular rutenburg and paltchinsky . petrograd cronstadt and finland were declared in a state of siegeupon which the bourgeois novoye vremya new times remarked ironically why the state of siege the government is no longer a power . it has no moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus to use force . . . . in the most favourable circumstances it can only negotiate with any one who consents to parley . its authority goes no farther . . . . monday morning the 5th i dropped in at the marinsky palace to see what was happening in the council of the russian republic . bitter debate on terestchenkos foreign policy . echoes of the burtzevverkhovski affair . all the diplomats present except the italian ambassador who everybody said was prostrated by the carso disaster . . . . as i came in the left socialist revolutionary karelin was reading aloud an editorial from the london times which said the remedy for bolshevism is bullets turning to the cadets he cried thats what you think too voices from the right yes yes yes i know you think so answered karelin hotly . but you havent the courage to try it then skobeliev looking like a matine idol with his soft blond beard and wavy yellow hair rather apologetically defending the soviet nakaz . terestchenko followed assailed from the left by cries of resignation resignation he insisted that the delegates of the government and of the tsayeekah to paris should have a common point of viewhis own . a few words about the restoration of discipline in the army about war to victory . . . . tumult and over the stubborn opposition of the truculent left the council of the republic passed to the simple order of the day . there stretched the rows of bolshevik seatsempty since that first day when they left the council carrying with them so much life . as i went down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitter wrangling no real voice from the rough world outside could penetrate this high cold hall and that the provisional government was wreckedon the same rock of war and peace that had wrecked the miliukov ministry . . . . the doorman grumbled as he put on my coat i dont know what is becoming of poor russia . all these mensheviki and bolsheviki and trudoviki . . . . this ukraine and this finland and the german imperialists and the english imperialists . i am fortyfive years old and in all my life i never heard so many words as in this place . . . . in the corridor i met professor shatsky a ratfaced individual in a dapper frockcoat very influential in the councils of the cadet party . i asked him what he thought of the muchtalkedof bolshevik vystuplennie . he shrugged sneering . they are cattlecanaille he answered . they will not dare or if they dare they will soon be sent flying . from our point of view it will not be bad for then they will ruin themselves and have no power in the constituent assembly . . . . but my dear sir allow me to outline to you my plan for a form of government to be submitted to the constituent assembly . you see i am chairman of a commission appointed from this body in conjunction with the provisional government to work out a constitutional project . . . . we will have a legislative assembly of two chambers such as you have in the united states . in the lower chamber will be territorial representatives in the upper representatives of the liberal professions zemstvos cooperativesand trade unions . . . . outside a chill damp wind came from the west and the cold mud underfoot soaked through my shoes . two companies of yunkers passed swinging up the morskaya tramping stiffly in their long coats and singing an oldtime crashing chorus such as the soldiers used to sing under the tsar . . . . at the first crossstreet i noticed that the city militiamen were mounted and armed with revolvers in bright new holsters a little group of people stood silently staring at them . at the corner of the nevsky i bought a pamphlet by lenin will the bolsheviki be able to hold the power paying for it with one of the stamps which did duty for small change . the usual streetcars crawled past citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to make theodore p . shonts green with envy . . . . along the sidewalk a row of deserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds . . . . up the nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for the latest papers and knots of people were trying to make out the multitudes of appeals see app . iii sect . 6 and proclamations pasted in every flat place from the tsayeekah the peasants soviets the moderate socialist parties the army committeesthreatening cursing beseeching the workers and soldiers to stay home to support the government . . . . an armoured automobile went slowly up and down siren screaming . on every corner in every open space thick groups were clustered arguing soldiers and students . night came swiftly down the widespaced streetlights flickered on the tides of people flowed endlessly . . . . it is always like that in petrograd just before trouble . . . . the city was nervous starting at every sharp sound . but still no sign from the bolsheviki the soldiers stayed in the barracks the workmen in the factories . . . . we went to a moving picture show near the kazan cathedrala bloody italian film of passion and intrigue . down front were some soldiers and sailors staring at the screen in childlike wonder totally unable to comprehend why there should be so much violent running about and so much homicide . . . . from there i hurried to smolny . in room 10 on the top floor the military revolutionary committee sat in continuous session under the chairmanship of a towheaded eighteenyearold boy named lazimir . he stopped as he passed to shake hands rather bashfully . peterpaul fortress has just come over to us said he with a pleased grin . a minute ago we got word from a regiment that was ordered by the government to come to petrograd . the men were suspicious so they stopped the train at gatchina and sent a delegation to us . whats the matter they asked . what have you got to say we have just passed a resolution all power to the soviets . . . . the military revolutionary committee sent back word brothers we greet you in the name of the revolution . stay where you are until further instructions all telephones he said were cut off but communication with the factories and barracks was established by means of military telephonograph apparatus . . . . a steady stream of couriers and commissars came and went . outside the door waited a dozen volunteers ready to carry word to the farthest quarters of the city . one of them a gypsyfaced man in the uniform of a lieutenant said in french everything is ready to move at the push of a button . . . . there passed podvoisky the thin bearded civillian whose brain conceived the strategy of insurrection antonov unshaven his collar filthy drunk with loss of sleep krylenko the squat widefaced soldier always smiling with his violent gestures and tumbling speech and dybenko the giant bearded sailor with the placid face . these were the men of the hourand of other hours to come . downstairs in the office of the factoryshop committees sat seratov signing orders on the government arsenal for armsone hundred and fifty rifles for each factory . . . . delegates waited in line forty of them . . . . in the hall i ran into some of the minor bolshevik leaders . one showed me a revolver . the game is on he said and his face was pale . whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish us or be finished . . . . the petrograd soviet was meeting day and night . as i came into the great hall trotzky was just finishing . we are asked he said if we intend to have a vystuplennie . i can give a clear answer to that question . the petrograd soviet feels that at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into the hands of the soviets . this transfer of government will be accomplished by the allrussian congress . whether an armed demonstration is necessary will depend on . . . those who wish to interfere with the allrussian congress . . . . we feel that our government entrusted to the personnel of the provisional cabinet is a pitiful and helpless government which only awaits the sweep of the broom of history to give way to a really popular government . but we are trying to avoid a conflict even now today . we hope that the allrussian congress will take . . . into its hands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedom of the people . if however the government wants to utilise the short period it is expected to livetwentyfour forty eight or seventytwo hoursto attack us then we shall answer with counterattacks blow for blow steel for iron amid cheers he announced that the left socialist revolutionaries had agreed to send representatives into the military revolutionary committee . . . . as i left smolny at three oclock in the morning i noticed that two rapidfiring guns had been mounted one on each side of the door and that strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the nearby streetcorners . bill shatov came bounding up the steps . well he well known in the american labor movement . cried were off kerensky sent the yunkers to close down our papers soldat and rabotchi put . but our troops went down and smashed the government seals and now were sending detachments to seize the bourgeois newspaper offices exultantly he slapped me on the shoulder and ran in . . . . on the morning of the 6th i had business with the censor whose office was in the ministry of foreign affairs . everywhere on all the walls hysterical appeals to the people to remain calm . polkovnikov emitted prikaz after prikaz i order all military units and detachments to remain in their barracks until further orders from the staff of the military district . . . . all officers who act without orders from their superiors will be courtmartialled for mutiny . i forbid absolutely any execution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations . . . . the morning papers announced that the government had suppressed the papers novaya rus zhivoye slovo rabotchi put and soldat and decreed the arrest of the leaders of the petrograd soviet and the members of the military revolutionary committee . . . . as i crossed the palace square several batteries of yunker artillery came through the red arch at a jingling trot and drew up before the palace . the great red building of the general staff was unusually animated several armoured automobiles ranked before the door and motors full of officers were coming and going . . . . the censor was very much excited like a small boy at a circus . kerensky he said had just gone to the council of the republic to offer his resignation . i hurried down to the marinsky palace arriving at the end of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of kerenskys full of selfjustification and bitter denunciation of his enemies . i will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole series of articles published in rabotchi put by ulianovlenin a state criminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find . . . . this state criminal has invited the proletariat and the petrograd garrison to repeat the experience of the 16th18th of july and insists upon the immediate necessity for an armed rising . . . . moreover other bolshevik leaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings and also made an appeal to immediate insurrection . particularly should be noticed the activity of the present president of the petrograd soviet bronsteintrotzky . . . . i ought to bring to your notice . . . that the expressions and the style of a whole series of articles in rabotchi put and soldat resemble absolutely those of novaya rus . . . . we have to do not so much with the movement of such and such political party as with the exploitation of the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of the population a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke in russia cost what it may an inconscient movement of destruction and pillage for given the state of mind of the masses any movement at petrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres which will cover with eternal shame the name of free russia . . . . . . . by the admission of ulianovlenin himself the situation of the extreme left wing of the social democrats in russia is very favourable . here kerensky read the following quotation from lenins article . think of it . . . the german comrades have only one liebknecht without newspapers without freedom of meeting without a soviet . . . . they are opposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of societyand yet the german comrades try to act while we having dozens of newspapers freedom of meeting the majority of the soviets we the bestplaced international proletarians of the entire world can we refuse to support the german revolutionists and insurrectionary organisations . . . kerensky then continued the organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the most perfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtain now in russia administered by a provisional government at the head of which is in the eyes of this party a usurper and a man who has sold himself to the bourgeoisie the ministerpresident kerensky . . . . . . . the organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of the german proletariat but of the german governing classes and they open the russian front to the iron fists of wilhelm and his friends . . . . little matter to the provisional government the motives of these people little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously but in any case from this tribune in full consciousness of my responsibility i quality such acts of a russian political party as acts of treason to russia . . . i place myself at the point of view of the right and i propose immediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessary arrests . uproar from the left . listen to me he cried in a powerful voice . at the moment when the state is in danger because of conscious or unconscious treason the provisional government and myself among others prefer to be killed rather than betray the life the honour and the independence of russia . . . . at this moment a paper was handed to kerensky . i have just received the proclamation which they are distributing to the regiments . here is the contents . reading the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies is menaced . we order immediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to await new orders . all delay or nonexecution of this order will be considered as an act of treason to the revolution . the military revolutionary committee . for the president podvoisky . the secretary antonov . in reality this is an attempt to raise the populace against the existing order of things to break the constituent and to open the front to the regiments of the iron fist of wilhelm . . . . i say populace intentionally because the conscious democracy and its tsayeekah all the army organisations all that free russia glorifies the good sense the honour and the conscience of the great russian democracy protests against these things . . . . i have not come here with a prayer but to state my firm conviction that the provisional government which defends at this moment our new libertythat the new russian state destined to a brilliant future will find unanimous support except among those who have never dared to face the truth . . . . . . . the provisional government has never violated the liberty of all citizens of the state to use their political rights . . . . but now the provisional government . . . . declares in this moment those elements of the russian nation those groups and parties who have dared to lift their hands against the free will of the russian people at the same time threatening to open the front to germany must be liquidated with decision . . . let the population of petrograd understand that it will encounter a firm power and perhaps at the last moment good sense conscience and honour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them . . . . all through this speech the hall rang with deafening clamour . when the ministerpresident had stepped down palefaced and wet with perspiration and strode out with his suite of officers speaker after speaker from the left and centre attacked the right all one angry roaring . even the socialist revolutionaries through gotz the policy of the bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal in their exploitation of the popular discontent . but there is a whole series of popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now . . . . the questions of peace land and the democratization of the army ought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier peasant or worker would have the least doubt that our government is attempting firmly and infallibly to solve them . . . . we mensheviki do not wish to provoke a cabinet crisis and we are ready to defend the provisional government with all our energy to the last drop of our bloodif only the provisional government on all these burning questions will speak the clear and precise words awaited by the people with such impatience . . . . then martov furious the words of the ministerpresident who allowed himself to speak of populace when it is question of the movement of important sections of the proletariat and the armyalthough led in the wrong directionare nothing but an incitement to civil war . the order of the day proposed by the left was voted . it amounted practically to a vote of lack of confidence . 1 . the armed demonstration which has been preparing for some days past has for its object a coup detat threatens to provoke civil war creates conditions favourable to pogroms and counterrevolution the mobilization of counterrevolutionary forces such as the black hundreds which will inevitably bring about the impossibility of convoking the constituent will cause a military catastrophe the death of the revolution paralyse the economic life of the country and destroy russia 2 . the conditions favourable to this agitation have been created by delay in passing urgent measures as well as objective conditions caused by the war and the general disorder . it is necessary before everything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land to the peasants land committees and to adopt an energetic course of action abroad in proposing to the allies to proclaim their peace terms and to begin peaceparleys 3 . to cope with monarchist manifestations and pogromist movements it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress these movements and for this purpose to create at petrograd a committee of public safety composed of representatives of the municipality and the organs of the revolutionary democracy acting in contact with the provisional government . . . . it is interesting to note that the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries all rallied to this resolution . . . . when kerensky saw it however he summoned avksentiev to the winter palace to explain . if it expressed a lack of confidence in the provisional government he begged avksentiev to form a new cabinet . dan gotz and avksentiev the leaders of the compromisers performed their last compromise . . . . they explained to kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism of the government at the corner of the morskaya and the nevsky squads of soldiers with fixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles turning out the occupants and ordering them toward the winter palace . a large crowd had gathered to watch them . nobody knew whether the soldiers belonged to the government or the military revolutionary committee . up in front of the kazan cathedral the same thing was happening machines being directed back up the nevsky . five or six sailors with rifles came along laughing excitedly and fell into conversation with two of the soldiers . on the sailors hat bands were avrora and zaria svobodythe names of the leading bolshevik cruisers of the baltic fleet . one of them said cronstadt is coming . . . it was as if in 1792 on the streets of paris some one had said the marseillais are coming for at cronstadt were twentyfive thousand sailors convinced bolsheviki and not afraid to die . . . . rabotchi i soldat was just out all its front page one huge proclamation soldiers workers citizens the enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive . the kornilovists of the staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs yunkers and volunteer battalions . the oranienbaum yunkers and the tsarskoye selo volunteers refused to come out . a stroke of high treason is being contemplated against the petrograd soviet . . . . the campaign of the counterrevolutionists is being directed against the allrussian congress of soviets on the eve of its opening against the constituent assembly against the people . the petrograd soviet is guarding the revolution . the military revolutionary committee is directing the repulse of the conspirators attack . the entire garrison and proletariat of petrograd are ready to deal the enemy of the people a crushing blow . the military revolutionary committee decrees 1 . all regimental division and battleship committees together with the soviet commissars and all revolutionary organisations shall meet in continuous session concentrating in their hands all information about the plans of the conspirators . 2 . not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of the committee . 3 . to send to smolny at once two delegates from each military unit and five from each ward soviet . 4 . all members of the petrograd soviet and all delegates to the allrussian congress are invited immediately to smolny for an extraordinary meeting . counterrevolution has raised its criminal head . a great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiers and workers . but the forces of the revolution by far exceed those of its enemies . the cause of the people is in strong hands . the conspirators will be crushed . no hesitation or doubts firmness steadfastness discipline determination long live the revolution the military revolutionary committee . the petrograd soviet was meeting continuously at smolny a centre of storm delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again to take part in the debate trotzky kameniev volodarsky speaking six eight twelve hours a day . . . . i went down to room 18 on the first floor where the bolshevik delegates were holding caucus a harsh voice steadily booming the speaker hidden by the crowd the compromisers say that we are isolated . pay no attention to them . once it begins they must be dragged along with us or else lose their following . . . . here he held up a piece of paper . we are dragging them a message has just come from the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries they say that they condemn our action but that if the government attacks us they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat exultant shouting . . . . as night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen a monstrous dun mass deephumming in a blue haze of smoke . the old tsayeekah had finally decided to welcome the delegates to that new congress which would mean its own ruinand perhaps the ruin of the revolutionary order it had built . at this meeting however only members of the tsayeekah could vote . . . . it was after midnight when gotz took the chair and dan rose to speak in a tense silence which seemed to me almost menacing . the hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours he said . the enemy is at the gates of petrograd the forces of the democracy are trying to organise to resist him and yet we await bloodshed in the streets of the capital and famine threatens to destroy not only our homogeneous government but the revolution itself . . . . the masses are sick and exhausted . they have no interest in the revolution . if the bolsheviki start anything that will be the end of the revolution . . . cries thats a lie the counterrevolutionists are waiting with the bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres . . . . if there is any vystuplennie there will be no constituent assembly . . . . cries lie shame it is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations the petrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the staff . . . . you must obey the orders of the staff and of the tsayeekah elected by you . all power to the sovietsthat means death robbers and thieves are waiting for the moment to loot and burn . . . . when you have such slogans put before you enter the houses take away the shoes and clothes from the bourgeoisie tumult . cries no such slogan a lie a lie well it may start differently but it will end that way the tsayeekah has full power to act and must be obeyed . . . . we are not afraid of bayonets . . . . the tsayeekah will defend the revolution with its body . . . . cries it was a dead body long ago immense continued uproar in which his voice could be heard screaming as he pounded the desk those who are urging this are committing a crime voice you committed a crime long ago when you captured the power and turned it over to the bourgeoisie gotz ringing the chairmans bell silence or ill have you put out voice try it cheers and whistling . now concerning our policy about peace . laughter . unfortunately russia can no longer support the continuation of the war . there is going to be peace but not permanent peacenot a democratic peace . . . . today at the council of the republic in order to avoid bloodshed we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land to the land committees and immediate peace negotiations . . . . laughter and cries too late then for the bolsheviki trotzky mounted the tribune borne on a wave of roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house thunderous . his thin pointed face was positively mephistophelian in its expression of malicious irony . dans tactics prove that the massesthe great dull indifferent massesare absolutely with him titantic mirth . he turned toward the chairman dramatically . when we spoke of giving the land to the peasants you were against it . we told the peasants if they dont give it to you take it yourselves and the peasants followed our advice . and now you advocate what we did six months ago . . . . i dont think kerenskys order to suspend the death penalty in the army was dictated by his ideals . i think kerensky was persuaded by the petrograd garrison which refused to obey him . . . . today dan is accused of having made a speech in the council of the republic which proves him to be a secret bolshevik . . . . the time may come when dan will say that the flower of the revolution participated in the rising of july 16th and 18th . . . . in dans resolution today at the council of the republic there was no mention of enforcing discipline in the army although that is urged in the propaganda of his party . . . . no . the history of the last seven months shows that the masses have left the mensheviki . the mensheviki and the socialist revolutionaries conquered the cadets and then when they got the power they gave it to the cadets . . . . dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection . insurrection is the right of all revolutionists when the downtrodden masses revolt it is their right . . . . then the longfaced crueltongued lieber greeted with groans and laughter . engels and marx said that the proletariat had no right to take power until it was ready for it . in a bourgeois revolution like this . . . . the seizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of the revolution . . . . trotzky as a social democratic theorist is himself opposed to what he is now advocating . . . . cries enough down with him martov constantly interrupted the internationalists are not opposed to the transmission of power to the democracy but they disapprove of the methods of the bolsheviki . this is not the moment to seize the power . . . . again dan took the floor violently protesting against the action of the military revolutionary committee which had sent a commissar to seize the office of izviestia and censor the paper . the wildest uproar followed . martov tried to speak but could not be heard . delegates of the army and the baltic fleet stood up all over the hall shouting that the soviet was their government . . . . amid the wildest confusion ehrlich offered a resolution appealing to the workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond to provocations to demonstrate recognising the necessity of immediately creating a committee of public safety and asking the provisional government at once to pass decrees transferring the land to the peasants and beginning peace negotiations . . . . then up leaped volodarsky shouting harshly that the tsayeekah on the eve of the congress had no right to assume the functions of the congress . the tsayeekah was practically dead he said and the resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power . . . . as for us bolsheviki we will not vote on this resolution whereupon all the bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution was passed . . . . toward four in the morning i met zorin in the outer hall a rifle slung from his shoulder . were moving see app . iii sect . 7 said he calmly but with satisfaction . we pinched the assistant minister of justice and the minister of religions . theyre down cellar now . one regiment is on the march to capture the telephone exchange another the telegraph agency another the state bank . the red guard is out . . . . on the steps of smolny in the chill dark we first saw the red guarda huddled group of boys in workmens clothes carrying guns with bayonets talking nervously together . far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered rifle fire where the yunkers were trying to open the bridges over the neva to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the viborg quarter from joining the soviet forces in the centre of the city and the cronstadt sailors were closing them again . . . . behind us great smolny bright with lights hummed like a gigantic hive . . . . chapter iv the fall of the provisional government wednesday november 7th i rose very late . the noon cannon boomed from peterpaul as i went down the nevsky . it was a raw chill day . in front of the state bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets were standing at the closed gates . what side do you belong to i asked . the government no more government one answered with a grin slava bogu glory to god that was all i could get out of him . . . . the streetcars were running on the nevsky men women and small boys hanging on every projection . shops were open and there seemed even less uneasiness among the street crowds than there had been the day before . a whole crop of new appeals against insurrection had blossomed out on the walls during the nightto the peasants to the soldiers at the front to the workmen of petrograd . one read from the petrograd municipal duma the municipal duma informs the citizens that in the extraordinary meeting of november 6th the duma formed a committee of public safety composed of members of the central and ward dumas and representatives of the following revolutionary democratic organizations the tsayeekah the allrussian executive committee of peasant deputies the army organisations the tsentroflot the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies the council of trade unions and others . members of the committee of public safety will be on duty in the building of the municipal duma . telephones no . 1540 22377 13836 . november 7th 1917 . though i didnt realize it then this was the dumas declaration of war against the bolsheviki . i bought a copy of rabotchi put the only newspaper which seemed on sale and a little later paid a soldier fifty kopeks for a secondhand copy of dien . the bolshevik paper printed on largesized sheets in the conquered office of the russkaya volia had huge headlines all powerto the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants peace bread land the leading article was signed zinovievlenins companion in hiding . it began every soldier every worker every real socialist every honest democrat realises that there are only two alternatives to the present situation . eitherthe power will remain in the hands of the bourgeoislandlord crew and this will mean every kind of repression for the workers soldiers and peasants continuation of the war inevitable hunger and death . . . . orthe power will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionary workers soldiers and peasants and in that case it will mean a complete abolition of landlord tyranny immediate check of the capitalists immediate proposal of a just peace . then the land is assured to the peasants then control of industry is assured to the workers then bread is assured to the hungry then the end of this nonsensical war . . . dien contained fragmentary news of the agitated night . bolsheviki capture of the telephone exchange the baltic station the telegraph agency the peterhof yunkers unable to reach petrograd the cossacks undecided arrest of some of the ministers shooting of chief of the city militia meyer arrests counterarrests skirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers yunkers and red guards . see app . iv sect . 1 on the corner of the morskaya i ran into captain gomberg menshevik oboronetz secretary of the military section of his party . when i asked him if the insurrection had really happened he shrugged his shoulders in a tired manner and replied tchort znayet the devil knows well perhaps the bolsheviki can seize the power but they wont be able to hold it more than three days . they havent the men to run a government . perhaps its a good thing to let them trythat will furnish them . . . . the military hotel at the corner of st . isaacs square was picketed by armed sailors . in the lobby were many of the smart young officers walking up and down or muttering together the sailors wouldnt let them leave . . . . suddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside followed by a scattered burst of firing . i ran out . something unusual was going on around the marinsky palace where the council of the russian republic met . diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line of soldiers rifles ready staring at the hotel roof . provacatzia shot at us snapped one while another went running toward the door . at the western corner of the palace lay a big armoured car with a red flag flying from it newly lettered in red paint s .r .s .d . soviet rabotchikh soldatskikh deputatov all the guns trained toward st . isaacs . a barricade had been heaped up across the mouth of novaya ulitzaboxes barrels an old bedspring a wagon . a pile of lumber barred the end of the moika quay . short logs from a neighbouring woodpile were being built up along the front of the building to form breastworks . . . . is there going to be any fighting i asked . soon soon answered a soldier nervously . go away comrade youll get hurt . they will come from that direction pointing toward the admiralty . who will that i couldnt tell you brother he answered and spat . before the door of the palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors . a sailor was telling of the end of the council of the russian republic . we walked in there he said and filled all the doors with comrades . i went up to the counterrevolutionist kornilovitz who sat in the presidents chair . no more council i says . run along home now there was laughter . by waving assorted papers i managed to get around to the door of the press gallery . there an enormous smiling sailor stopped me and when i showed my pass just said if you were saint michael himself comrade you couldnt pass here through the glass of the door i made out the distorted face and gesticulating arms of a french correspondent locked in . . . . around in front stood a little greymoustached man in the uniform of a general the centre of a knot of soldiers . he was very red in the face . i am general alexeyev he cried . as your superior officer and as a member of the council of the republic i demand to be allowed to pass the guard scratched his head looking uneasily out of the corner of his eye he beckoned to an approaching officer who grew very agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realised what he was doing . vashe vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvoyour high excellency he stammered in the manner of the old rgime access to the palace is strictly forbiddeni have no right an automobile came by and i saw gotz sitting inside laughing apparently with great amusement . a few minutes later another with armed soldiers on the front seat full of arrested members of the provisional government . peters lettish member of the military revolutionary committee came hurrying across the square . i thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night said i pointing to them . oh he answered with the expression of a disappointed small boy . the damn fools let most of them go again before we made up our minds . . . . down the voskressensky prospect a great mass of sailors were drawn up and behind them came marching soldiers as far as the eye could reach . we went toward the winter palace by way of the admiralteisky . all the entrances to the palace square were closed by sentries and a cordon of troops stretched clear across the western end besieged by an uneasy throng of citizens . except for faraway soldiers who seemed to be carrying wood out of the palace courtyard and piling it in front of the main gateway everything was quiet . we couldnt make out whether the sentries were progovernment or prosoviet . our papers from smolny had no effect however so we approached another part of the line with an important air and showed our american passports saying official business and shouldered through . at the door of the palace the same old shveitzari in their brassbuttoned blue uniforms with the redandgold collars politely took our coats and hats and we went upstairs . in the dark gloomy corridor stripped of its tapestries a few old attendants were lounging about and in front of kerenskys door a young officer paced up and down gnawing his moustache . we asked if we could interview the ministerpresident . he bowed and clicked his heels . no i am sorry he replied in french . alexander feodorvitch is extremely occupied just now . . . . he looked at us for a moment . in fact he is not here . . . . where is he he has gone to the front . see app . iv sect . 2 and do you know there wasnt enough gasoline for his automobile . we had to send to the english hospital and borrow some . are the ministers here they are meeting in some roomi dont know where . are the bolsheviki coming of course . certainly they are coming . i expect a telephone call every minute to say that they are coming . but we are ready . we have yunkers in the front of the palace . through that door there . can we go in there no . certainly not . it is not permitted . abruptly he shook hands all around and walked away . we turned to the forbidden door set in a temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside . on the other side were voices and somebody laughing . except for that the vast spaces of the old palace were silent as the grave . an old shveitzar ran up . no barin you must not go in there . why is the door locked to keep the soldiers in he answered . after a few minutes he said something about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall . we unlocked the door . just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard but they said nothing . at the end of the corridor was a large ornate room with gilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres and beyond it several smaller ones wainscoted with dark wood . on both sides of the parquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets upon which occasional soldiers were stretched out everywhere was a litter of cigarettebutts bits of bread cloth and empty bottles with expensive french labels . more and more soldiers with the red shoulderstraps of the yunkerschools moved about in a stale atmosphere of tobaccosmoke and unwashed humanity . one had a bottle of white burgundy evidently filched from the cellars of the palace . they looked at us with astonishment as we marched past through room after room until at last we came out into a series of great statesalons fronting their long and dirty windows on the square . the walls were covered with huge canvases in massive gilt frameshistorical battlescenes . . . . 12 october 1812 and 6 november 1812 and 1628 august 1813 . . . . one had a gash across the upper right hand corner . the place was all a huge barrack and evidently had been for weeks from the look of the floor and walls . machine guns were mounted on windowsills rifles stacked between the mattresses . as we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed me from the region of my left ear and a voice said in thick but fluent french i see by the way you admire the paintings that you are foreigners . he was a short puffy man with a baldish head as he removed his cap . americans enchanted . i am stabscapitan vladimir artzibashev absolutely at your service . it did not seem to occur to him that there was anything unusual in four strangers one a woman wandering through the defences of an army awaiting attack . he began to complain of the state of russia . not only these bolsheviki he said but the fine traditions of the russian army are broken down . look around you . these are all students in the officers training schools . but are they gentlemen kerensky opened the officers schools to the ranks to any soldier who could pass an examination . naturally there are many many who are contaminated by the revolution . . . . without consequence he changed the subject . i am very anxious to go away from russia . i have made up my mind to join the american army . will you please go to your consul and make arrangements i will give you my address . in spite of our protestations he wrote it on a piece of paper and seemed to feel better at once . i have it stilloranienbaumskaya shkola praporshtchikov 2nd staraya peterhof . we had a review this morning early he went on as he guided us through the rooms and explained everything . the womens battalion decided to remain loyal to the government . are the women soldiers in the palace yes they are in the back rooms where they wont be hurt if any trouble comes . he sighed . it is a great responsibility said he . for a while we stood at the window looking down on the square before the palace where three companies of longcoated yunkers were drawn up under arms being harangued by a tall energeticlooking officer i recognised as stankievitch chief military commissar of the provisional government . after a few minutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash barked three sharp shouts and went swinging off across the square disappearing through the red arch into the quiet city . they are going to capture the telephone exchange said some one . three cadets stood by us and we fell into conversation . they said they had entered the schools from the ranks and gave their namesrobert olev alexei vasilienko and erni sachs an esthonian . but now they didnt want to be officers any more because officers were very unpopular . they didnt seem to know what to do as a matter of fact and it was plain that they were not happy . but soon they began to boast . if the bolsheviki come we shall show them how to fight . they do not dare to fight they are cowards . but if we should be overpowered well every man keeps one bullet for himself . . . . at this point there was a burst of riflefire not far off . out on the square all the people began to run falling flat on their faces and the izvoshtchiki standing on the corners galloped in every direction . inside all was uproar soldiers running here and there grabbing up guns riflebelts and shouting here they come here they come . . . but in a few minutes it quieted down again . the izvoshtchiki came back the people lying down stood up . through the red arch appeared the yunkers marching a little out of step one of them supported by two comrades . it was getting late when we left the palace . the sentries in the square had all disappeared . the great semicircle of government buildings seemed deserted . we went into the hotel france for dinner and right in the middle of soup the waiter very pale in the face came up and insisted that we move to the main diningroom at the back of the house because they were going to put out the lights in the caf . there will be much shooting he said . when we came out on the morskaya again it was quite dark except for one flickering streetlight on the corner of the nevsky . under this stood a big armored automobile with racing engine and oilsmoke pouring out of it . a small boy had climbed up the side of the thing and was looking down the barrel of a machine gun . soldiers and sailors stood around evidently waiting for something . we walked back up to the red arch where a knot of soldiers was gathered staring at the brightlylighted winter palace and talking in loud tones . no comrades one was saying . how can we shoot at them the womens battalion is in therethey will say we have fired on russian women . as we reached the nevsky again another armoured car came around the corner and a man poked his head out of the turrettop . come on he yelled . lets go on through and attack the driver of the other car came over and shouted so as to be heard above the roaring engine . the committee says to wait . they have got artillery behind the woodpiles in there . . . . here the streetcars had stopped running few people passed and there were no lights but a few blocks away we could see the trams the crowds the lighted shopwindows and the electric signs of the movingpicture showslife going on as usual . we had tickets to the ballet at the marinsky theatreall theatres were openbut it was too exciting out of doors . . . . in the darkness we stumbled over lumberpiles barricading the police bridge and before the stroganov palace made out some soldiers wheeling into position a threeinch fieldgun . men in various uniforms were coming and going in an aimless way and doing a great deal of talking . . . . up the nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading . on every corner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion . pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at the streetcrossings redfaced old men in rich fur coats shook their fists at them smartlydressed women screamed epithets the soldiers argued feebly with embarrassed grins . . . . armoured cars went up and down the street named after the first tsarsoleg rurik svietoslavand daubed with huge red letters r . s . d . r . p . rossiskaya partia . at the mikhailovsky a man appeared with an russian social democratic labor party . armful of newspapers and was immediately stormed by frantic people offering a rouble five roubles ten roubles tearing at each other like animals . it was rabotchi i soldat announcing the victory of the proletarian revolution the liberation of the bolsheviki still in prison calling upon the army front and rear for support . . . a feverish little sheet of four pages running to enormous type containing no news . . . . on the corner of the sadovaya about two thousand citizens had gathered staring up at the roof of a tall building where a tiny red spark glowed and waned . see said a tall peasant pointing to it . it is a provocator . presently he will fire on the people . . . . apparently no one thought of going to investigate . the massive facade of smolny blazed with lights as we drove up and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom . automobiles and motorcycles came and went an enormous elephantcoloured armoured automobile with two red flags flying from the turret lumbered out with screaming siren . it was cold and at the outer gate the red guards had built themselves a bonfire . at the inner gate too there was a blaze by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down . the canvas covers had been taken off the four rapidfire guns on each side of the doorway and the ammunitionbelts hung snakelike from their breeches . a dun herd of armoured cars stood under the trees in the courtyard engines going . the long bare dimlyilluminated halls roared with the thunder of feet calling shouting . . . . there was an atmosphere of recklessness . a crowd came pouring down the staircase workers in black blouses and round black fur hats many of them with guns slung over their shoulders soldiers in rough dirtcoloured coats and grey fur shapki pinched flat a leader or solunatcharsky kamenievhurrying along in the centre of a group all talking at once with harassed anxious faces and bulging portfolios under their arms . the extraordinary meeting of the petrograd soviet was over . i stopped kamenieva quick moving little man with a wide vivacious face set close to his shoulders . without preface he read in rapid french a copy of the resolution just passed the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies saluting the victorious revolution of the petrograd proletariat and garrison particularly emphasises the unity organisation discipline and complete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising rarely has less blood been spilled and rarely has an insurrection succeeded so well . the soviet expresses its firm conviction that the workers and peasants government which as the government of the soviets will be created by the revolution and which will assure the industrial proletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants will march firmly toward socialism the only means by which the country can be spared the miseries and unheardof horrors of war . the new workers and peasants government will propose immediately a just and democratic peace to all the belligerent countries . it will suppress immediately the great landed property and transfer the land to the peasants . it will establish workmens control over production and distribution of manufactured products and will set up a general control over the banks which it will transform into a state monopoly . the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies calls upon the workers and the peasants of russia to support with all their energy and all their devotion the proletarian revolution . the soviet expresses its conviction that the city workers allies of the poor peasants will assure complete revolutionary order indispensable to the victory of socialism . the soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the countries of western europe will aid us in conducting the cause of socialism to a real and lasting victory . you consider it won then he lifted his shoulders . there is much to do . horribly much . it is just beginning . . . . on the landing i met riazanov vicepresident of the trade unions looking black and biting his grey beard . its insane insane he shouted . the european workingclass wont move all russia he waved his hand distractedly and ran off . riazanov and kameniev had both opposed the insurrection and felt the lash of lenins terrible tongue . . . . it had been a momentous session . in the name of the military revolutionary committee trotzky had declared that the provisional government no longer existed . the characteristic of bourgeois governments he said is to deceive the people . we the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies are going to try an experiment unique in history we are going to found a power which will have no other aim but to satisfy the needs of the soldiers workers and peasants . lenin had appeared welcomed with a mighty ovation prophesying worldwide social revolution . . . . and zinoviev crying this day we have paid our debt to the international proletariat and struck a terrible blow at the war a terrible bodyblow at all the imperialists and particularly at wilhelm the executioner . . . . then trotzky that telegrams had been sent to the front announcing the victorious insurrection but no reply had come . troops were said to be marching against petrograda delegation must be sent to tell them the truth . cries you are anticipating the will of the allrussian congress of soviets trotzky coldly the will of the allrussian congress of soviets has been anticipated by the rising of the petrograd workers and soldiers so we came into the great meetinghall pushing through the clamorous mob at the door . in the rows of seats under the white chandeliers packed immovably in the aisles and on the sides perched on every windowsill and even the edge of the platform the representatives of the workers and soldiers of all russia waited in anxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairmans bell . there was no heat in the hall but the stifling heat of unwashed human bodies . a foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke rose from the mass and hung in the thick air . occasionally some one in authority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to smoke then everybody smokers and all took up the cry dont smoke comrades and went on smoking . petrovsky anarchist delegate from the obukhov factory made a seat for me beside him . unshaven and filthy he was reeling from three nights sleepless work on the military revolutionary committee . on the platform sat the leaders of the old tsayeekahfor the last time dominating the turbulent soviets which they had ruled from the first days and which were now risen against them . it was the end of the first period of the russian revolution which these men had attempted to guide in careful ways . . . . the three greatest of them were not there kerensky flying to the front through country towns all doubtfully heaving up tcheidze the old eagle who had contemptuously retired to his own georgian mountains there to sicken with consumption and the highsouled tseretelli also mortally stricken who nevertheless would return and pour out his beautiful eloquence for a lost cause . gotz sat there dan lieber bogdanov broido fillipovskywhitefaced holloweyed and indignant . below them the second siezd of the allrussian soviets boiled and swirled and over their heads the military revolutionary committee functioned whitehot holding in its hands the threads of insurrection and striking with a long arm . . . . it was 10 .40 p . m . dan a mildfaced baldish figure in a shapeless military surgeons uniform was ringing the bell . silence fell sharply intense broken by the scuffling and disputing of the people at the door . . . . we have the power in our hands he began sadly stopped for a moment and then went on in a low voice . comrades the congress of soviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such an extraordinary moment that you will understand why the tsayeekah considers it unnecessary to address you with a political speech . this will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that i am a member of the tsayeekah and that at this very moment our party comrades are in the winter palace under bombardment sacrificing themselves to execute the duty put on them by the tsayeekah . confused uproar . i declare the first session of the second congress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputies open the election of the presidium took place amid stir and moving about . avanessov announced that by agreement of the bolsheviki left socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki internationalists it was decided to base the presidium upon proportionality . several mensheviki leaped to their feet protesting . a bearded soldier shouted at them remember what you did to us bolsheviki when we were the minority result14 bolsheviki 7 socialist revolutionaries 3 mensheviki and 1 internationalist gorkys group . hendelmann for the right and centre socialist revolutionaries said that they refused to take part in the presidium the same from kintchuk for the mensheviki and from the mensheviki internationalists that until the verification of certain circumstances they too could not enter the presidium . scattering applause and hoots . one voice renegades you call yourselves socialists a representative of the ukrainean delegates demanded and received a place . then the old tsayeekah stepped down and in their places appeared trotzky kameniev lunatcharsky madame kollentai nogin . . . . the hall rose thundering . how far they had soared these bolsheviki from a despised and hunted sect less than four months ago to this supreme place the helm of great russia in full tide of insurrection the order of the day said kameniev was first organisation of power second war and peace and third the constituent assembly . lozovsky rising announced that upon agreement of the bureau of all factions it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of the petrograd soviet then to give the floor to members of the tsayeekah and the different parties and finally to pass to the order of the day . but suddenly a new sound made itself heard deeper than the tumult of the crowd persistent disquietingthe dull shock of guns . people looked anxiously toward the clouded windows and a sort of fever came over them . martov demanding the floor croaked hoarsely the civil war is beginning comrades the first question must be a peaceful settlement of the crisis . on principle and from a political standpoint we must urgently discuss a means of averting civil war . our brothers are being shot down in the streets at this moment when before the opening of the congress of soviets the question of power is being settled by means of a military plot organised by one of the revolutionary parties for a moment he could not make himself heard above the noise all of the revolutionary parties must face the fact the first vopros question before the congress is the question of power and this question is already being settled by force of arms in the streets . . . we must create a power which will be recognised by the whole democracy . if the congress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy it must not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war the result of which may be a dangerous outburst of counterrevolution . . . . the possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of a united democratic authority . . . . we must elect a delegation to negotiate with the other socialist parties and organisation . . . . always the methodical muffled boom of cannon through the windows and the delegates screaming at each other . . . . so with the crash of artillery in the dark with hatred and fear and reckless daring new russia was being born . the left socialist revolutionaries and the united social democrats supported martovs proposition . it was accepted . a soldier announced that the allrussian peasants soviets had refused to send delegates to the congress he proposed that a committee be sent with a formal invitation . some delegates are present he said . i move that they be given votes . accepted . kharash wearing the epaulets of a captain passionately demanded the floor . the political hypocrites who control this congress he shouted told us we were to settle the question of powerand it is being settled behind our backs before the congress opens blows are being struck against the winter palace and it is by such blows that the nails are being driven into the coffin of the political party which has risked such an adventure uproar . followed him gharra while we are here discussing propositions of peace there is a battle on in the streets . . . . the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening and call upon all public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power . . . . kutchin delegate of the 12th army and representative of the troudoviki i was sent here only for information and i am returning at once to the front where all the army committees consider that the taking of power by the soviets only three weeks before the constituent assembly is a stab in the back of the army and a crime against the people shouts of lie you lie . . . when he could be heard again lets make an end of this adventure in petrograd i call upon all delegates to leave this hall in order to save the country and the revolution as he went down the aisle in the midst of a deafening noise people surged in upon him threatening . . . . then khintchuk an officer with a long brown goatee speaking suavely and persuasively i speak for the delegates from the front . the army is imperfectly represented in this congress and furthermore the army does not consider the congress of soviets necessary at this time only three weeks before the opening of the constituent shouts and stamping always growing more violent . the army does not consider that the congress of soviets has the necessary authority soldiers began to stand up all over the hall . who are you speaking for what do you represent they cried . the central executive committee of the soviet of the fifth army the second f regiment the first n regiment the third s rifles . . . . when were you elected you represent the officers not the soldiers what do the soldiers say about it jeers and hoots . we the front group disclaim all responsibility for what has happened and is happening and we consider it necessary to mobilise all selfconscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of the revolution the front group will leave the congress . . . . the place to fight is out on the streets immense bawling outcry . you speak for the staffnot for the army i appeal to all reasonable soldiers to leave this congress kornilovitz counterrevolutionist provocator were hurled at him . on behalf of the mensheviki khintchuk then announced that the only possibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations with the provisional government for the formation of a new cabinet which would find support in all strata of society . he could not proceed for several minutes . raising his voice to a shout he read the menshevik declaration because the bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aid of the petrograd soviet without consulting the other factions and parties we find it impossible to remain in the congress and therefore withdraw inviting the other groups to follow us and to meet for discussion of the situation deserter at intervals in the almost continuous disturbance hendelman for the socialist revolutionaries could be heard protesting against the bombardment of the winter palace . . . . we are opposed to this kind of anarchy . . . . scarcely had he stepped down than a young leanfaced soldier with flashing eyes leaped to the platform and dramatically lifted his hand comrades he cried and there was a hush . my familia name is petersoni speak for the second lettish rifles . you have heard the statements of two representatives of the army committees these statements would have some value if their authors had been representatives of the army wild applause . but they do not represent the soldiers shaking his fist . the twelfth army has been insisting for a long time upon the reelection of the great soviet and the army committee but just as your own tsayeekah our committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives of the masses until the end of september so that the reactionaries could elect their own false delegates to this congress . i tell you now the lettish soldiers have many times said no more resolutions no more talk we want deedsthe power must be in our hands let these impostor delegates leave the congress the army is not with them the hall rocked with cheering . in the first moments of the session stunned by the rapidity of events startled by the sound of cannon the delegates had hesitated . for an hour hammerblow after hammerblow had fallen from that tribune welding them together but beating them down . did they stand then alone was russia rising against them was it true that the army was marching on petrograd then this cleareyed young soldier had spoken and in a flash they knew it for the truth . . . . this was the voice of the soldiersthe stirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men like them and their thoughts and feelings were the same . . . more soldiers . . . gzhelshakh for the front delegates announcing that they had only decided to leave the congress by a small majority and that the bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote as they stood for division according to political parties and not groups . hundreds of delegates from the front he said are being elected without the participation of the soldiers because the army committees are no longer the real representatives of the rank and file . . . . lukianov crying that officers like kharash and khintchuk could not represent the army in this congressbut only the high command . the real inhabitants of the trenches want with all their hearts the transfer of power into the hands of the soviets and they expect very much from it . . . the tide was turning . then came abramovitch for the bund the organ of the jewish social democratshis eyes snapping behind thick glasses trembling with rage . what is taking place now in petrograd is a monstrous calamity the bund group joins with the declaration of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and will leave the congress he raised his voice and hand . our duty to the russian proletariat doesnt permit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes . because the firing on the winter palace doesnt cease the municipal duma together with the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and the executive committee of the peasants soviet has decided to perish with the provisional government and we are going with them unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of the terrorists . . . . we invite all delegates to this congress the rest was lost in a storm of hoots menaces and curses which rose to a hellish pitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out . . . . kameniev jangled the bell shouting keep your seats and well go on with our business and trotzky standing up with a pale cruel face letting out his rich voice in cool contempt all these socalled socialist compromisers these frightened mensheviki socialist revolutionaries bundlet them go they are just so much refuse which will be swept into the garbageheap of history riazanov for the bolsheviki stated that at the request of the city duma the military revolutionary committee had sent a delegation to offer negotiations to the winter palace . in this way we have done everything possible to avoid bloodshed . . . . we hurried from the place stopping for a moment at the room where the military revolutionary committee worked at furious speed engulfing and spitting out panting couriers despatching commissars armed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city amid the buzz of the telephonographs . the door opened a blast of stale air and cigarette smoke rushed out we caught a glimpse of dishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shaded electriclight . . . . comrade josephovdukhvinski a smiling youth with a mop of pale yellow hair made out passes for us . when we came into the chill night all the front of smolny was one huge park of arriving and departing automobiles above the sound of which could be heard the faroff slow beat of the cannon . a great motortruck stood there shaking to the roar of its engine . men were tossing bundles into it and others receiving them with guns beside them . where are you going i shouted . downtownall overeverywhere answered a little workman grinning with a large exultant gesture . we showed our passes . come along they invited . but therell probably be shooting we climbed in the clutch slid home with a raking jar the great car jerked forward we all toppled backward on top of those who were climbing in past the huge fire by the gate and then the fire by the outer gate glowing red on the faces of the workmen with rifles who squatted around it and went bumping at top speed down the suvorovsky prospect swaying from side to side . . . . one man tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of l handfuls of papers into the air . we imitated him plunging down through the dark street with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind . the late passerby stooped to pick them up the patrols around bonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them . sometimes armed men loomed up ahead crying shtoi and raising their guns but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligible and we hurtled on . . . . i picked up a copy of the paper and under a fleeting streetlight read to the citizens of russia the provisional government is deposed . the state power has passed into the hands of the organ of the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies the military revolutionary committee which stands at the head of the petrograd proletariat and garrison . the cause for which the people were fighting immediate proposal of a democratic peace abolition of landlord propertyrights over the land labor control over production creation of a soviet governmentthat cause is securely achieved . long live the revolution of workmen soldiers and peasants military revolutionary committee petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies . graphic page96 proclamation in russian title follows 111 proclamation of the fall of the provisional government issued by the military revolutionary committee on the night of november 7th our calendar which we helped to distribute from a motortruck just after the surrender of the winter palace . a slanteyed mongolianfaced man who sat beside me dressed in a goatskin caucasian cape snapped look out here the provocators always shoot from the windows we turned into znamensky square dark and almost deserted careened around trubetskoys brutal statue and swung down the wide nevsky three men standing up with rifles ready peering at the windows . behind us the street was alive with people running and stooping . we could no longer hear the cannon and the nearer we drew to the winter palace end of the city the quieter and more deserted were the streets . the city duma was all brightly lighted . beyond that we made out a dark mass of people and a line of sailors who yelled furiously at us to stop . the machine slowed down and we climbed out . it was an astonishing scene . just at the corner of the ekaterina canal under an arclight a cordon of armed sailors was drawn across the nevsky blocking the way to a crowd of people in column of fours . there were about three or four hundred of them men in frock coats welldressed women officersall sorts and conditions of people . among them we recognised many of the delegates from the congress leaders of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries avksentiev the lean redbearded president of the peasants soviets sarokin kerenskys spokesman khintchuk abramovitch and at the head whitebearded old schreider mayor of petrograd and prokopovitch minister of supplies in the provisional government arrested that morning and released . i caught sight of malkin reporter for the russian daily news . going to die in the winter palace he shouted cheerfully . the procession stood still but from the front of it came loud argument . schreider and prokopovitch were bellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command . we demand to pass they cried . see these comrades come from the congress of soviets look at their tickets we are going to the winter palace the sailor was plainly puzzled . he scratched his head with an enormous hand frowning . i have orders from the committee not to let anybody go to the winter palace he grumbled . but i will send a comrade to telephone to smolny . . . . we insist upon passing we are unarmed we will march on whether you permit us or not cried old schreider very much excited . i have orders repeated the sailor sullenly . shoot us if you want to we will pass forward came from all sides . we are ready to die if you have the heart to fire on russians and comrades we bare our breasts to your guns no said the sailor looking stubborn i cant allow you to pass . what will you do if we go forward will you shoot no im not going to shoot people who havent any guns . we wont shoot unarmed russian people . . . . we will go forward what can you do we will do somethingreplied the sailor evidently at a loss . we cant let you pass . we will do something . what will you do what will you do another sailor came up very much irritated . we will spank you he cried energetically . and if necessary we will shoot you too . go home now and leave us in peace at this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box and waving his umbrella he made a speech comrades and citizens he said . force is being used against us we cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorant men it is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street by switchmen what he meant by switchmen i never discovered . let us return to the duma and discuss the best means of saving the country and the revolution whereupon in dignified silence the procession marched around and back up the nevsky always in column of fours . and taking advantage of the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in the direction of the winter palace . here it was absolutely dark and nothing moved but pickets of soldiers and red guards grimly intent . in front of the kazan cathedral a threeinch fieldgun lay in the middle of the street slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs . soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones and peering down toward the police bridge . i heard one voice saying it is possible that we have done wrong . . . . at the corners patrols stopped all passersbyand the composition of these patrols was interesting for in command of the regular troops was invariably a red guard . . . . the shooting had ceased . just as we came to the morskaya somebody was shouting the yunkers have sent word they want us to go and get them out voices began to give commands and in the thick gloom we made out a dark mass moving forward silent but for the shuffle of feet and the clinking of arms . we fell in with the first ranks . like a black river filling all the street without song or cheer we poured through the red arch where the man just ahead of me said in a low voice look out comrades dont trust them . they will fire surely in the open we began to run stooping low and bunching together and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of the alexander column . how many of you did they kill i asked . i dont know . about ten . . . . after a few minutes huddling there some hundreds of men the army seemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flow forward . by this time in the light that streamed out of all the winter palace windows i could see that the first two or three hundred men were red guards with only a few scattered soldiers . over the barricade of firewood we clambered and leaping down inside gave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles thrown down by the yunkers who had stood there . on both sides of the main gateway the doors stood wide open light streamed out and from the huge pile came not the slightest sound . carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the right hand entrance opening into a great bare vaulted room the cellar of the east wing from which issued a maze of corridors and staircases . a number of huge packing cases stood about and upon these the red guards and soldiers fell furiously battering them open with the butts of their rifles and pulling out carpets curtains linen porcelain plates glassware . . . . one man went strutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder another found a plume of ostrich feathers which he stuck in his hat . the looting was just beginning when somebody cried comrades dont touch anything dont take anything this is the property of the people immediately twenty voices were crying stop put everything back dont take anything property of the people many hands dragged the spoilers down . damask and tapestry were snatched from the arms of those who had them two men took away the bronze clock . roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in their cases and selfappointed sentinels stood guard . it was all utterly spontaneous . through corridors and up staircases the cry could be heard growing fainter and fainter in the distance revolutionary discipline property of the people . . . . we crossed back over to the left entrance in the west wing . there order was also being established . clear the palace bawled a red guard sticking his head through an inner door . come comrades lets show that were not thieves and bandits . everybody out of the palace except the commissars until we get sentries posted . two red guards a soldier and an officer stood with revolvers in their hands . another soldier sat at a table behind them with pen and paper . shouts of all out all out were heard far and near within and the army began to pour through the door jostling expostulating arguing . as each man appeared he was seized by the selfappointed committee who went through his pockets and looked under his coat . everything that was plainly not his property was taken away the man at the table noted it on his paper and it was carried into a little room . the most amazing assortment of objects were thus confiscated statuettes bottles of ink bedspreads worked with the imperial monogram candles a small oilpainting desk blotters goldhandled swords cakes of soap clothes of every description blankets . one red guard carried three rifles two of which he had taken away from yunkers another had four portfolios bulging with written documents . the culprits either sullenly surrendered or pleaded like children . all talking at once the committee explained that stealing was not worthy of the peoples champions often those who had been caught turned around and began to help go through the rest of the comrades . see app . iv sect . 3 yunkers came out in bunches of three or four . the committee seized upon them with an excess of zeal accompanying the search with remarks like ah provocators kornilovists counterrevolutionists murderers of the people but there was no violence done although the yunkers were terrified . they too had their pockets full of small plunder . it was carefully noted down by the scribe and piled in the little room . . . . the yunkers were disarmed . now will you take up arms against the people any more demanded clamouring voices . no answered the yunkers one by one . whereupon they were allowed to go free . we asked if we might go inside . the committee was doubtful but the big red guard answered firmly that it was forbidden . who are you anyway he asked . how do i know that you are not all kerenskys there were five of us two women . pazhalst touarishtchi way comrades a soldier and a red guard appeared in the door waving the crowd aside and other guards with fixed bayonets . after them followed single file half a dozen men in civilian dressthe members of the provisional government . first came kishkin his face drawn and pale then rutenberg looking sullenly at the floor terestchenko was next glancing sharply around he stared at us with cold fixity . . . . they passed in silence the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see but there were only a few angry mutterings . it was only later that we learned how the people in the street wanted to lynch them and shots were firedbut the sailors brought them safely to peterpaul . . . . in the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the palace . there was still a great deal of coming and going of exploring newfound apartments in the vast edifice of searching for hidden garrisons of yunkers which did not exist . we went upstairs and wandered through room after room . this part of the palace had been entered also by other detachments from the side of the neva . the paintings statues tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed in the offices however every desk and cabinet had been ransacked the papers scattered over the floor and in the living rooms beds had been stripped of their coverings and wardrobes wrenched open . the most highly prized loot was clothing which the working people needed . in a room where furniture was stored we came upon two soldiers ripping the elaborate spanish leather upholstery from chairs . they explained it was to make boots with . . . . the old palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniforms stood nervously about from force of habit repeating you cant go in there barin it is forbidden we penetrated at length to the gold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where the ministers had been in session all that day and night and where the shveitzari had betrayed them to the red guards . the long table covered with green baize was just as they had left it under arrest . before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper the papers were scribbled over with beginnings of plans of action rough drafts of proclamations and manifestos . most of these were scratched out as their futility became evident and the rest of the sheet covered with absentminded geometrical designs as the writers sat despondently listening while minister after minister proposed chimerical schemes . i took one of these scribbled pages in the hand writing of konovalov which read the provisional government appeals to all classes to support the provisional government all this time it must be remembered although the winter palace was surrounded the government was in constant communication with the front and with provincial russia . the bolsheviki had captured the ministry of war early in the morning but they did not know of the military telegraph office in the attic nor of the private telephone line connecting it with the winter palace . in that attic a young officer sat all day pouring out over the country a flood of appeals and proclamations and when he heard that the palace had fallen put on his hat and walked calmly out of the building . . . . interested as we were for a considerable time we didnt notice a change in the attitude of the soldiers and red guards around us . as we strolled from room to room a small group followed us until by the time we reached the great picturegallery where we had spent the afternoon with the yunkers about a hundred men surged in after us . one giant of a soldier stood in our path his face dark with sullen suspicion . graphic page104 doodling by konavalov title follows facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation written in pencil by a .i . konovalov minister of commerce and industry in he provisional government and then scratched out as the hopelessness of the situation became more and more evident . the geometrical figure beneath was probably idly drawn while the ministers were waiting for the end . who are you he growled . what are you doing here the others massed slowly around staring and beginning to mutter . provocatori i heard somebody say . looters i produced our passes from the military revolutionary committee . the soldier took them gingerly turned them upside down and looked at them without comprehension . evidently he could not read . he handed them back and spat on the floor . bumagi papers said he with contempt . the mass slowly began to close in like wild cattle around a cowpuncher on foot . over their heads i caught sight of an officer looking helpless and shouted to him . he made for us shouldering his way through . im the commissar he said to me . who are you what is it the others held back waiting . i produced the papers . you are foreigners he rapidly asked in franch . it is very dangerous . . . . then he turned to the mob holding up our documents . comrades he cried . these people are foreign comradesfrom america . they have come here to be able to tell their countrymen about the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army how do you know that replied the big soldier . i tell you they are provocators they say they came here to observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army but they have been wandering freely through the palace and how do we know they havent got their pockets full of loot pravilno snarled the others pressing forward . comrades comrades appealed the officer sweat standing out on his forehead . i am commissar of the military revolutionary committee . do you trust me well i tell you that these passes are signed with the same names that are signed to my pass he led us down through the palace and out through a door opening onto the neva quay before which stood the usual committee going through pockets . . . you have narrowly escaped he kept muttering wiping his face . what happened to the womens battalion we asked . ohthe women he laughed . they were all huddled up in a back room . we had a terrible time deciding what to do with themmany were in hysterics and so on . so finally we marched them up to the finland station and put them on a train for levashovo where they have a camp . see app . iv sect . 4 . . . . we came out into the cold nervous night murmurous with obscure armies on the move electric with patrols . from across the river where loomed the darker mass of peterpaul came a hoarse shout . . . . underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco from the cornice of the palace where two shells from the battleship avrora had struck that was the only damage done by the bombardment . . . . it was now after three in the morning . on the nevsky all the streetlights were again shining the cannon gone and the only signs of war were red guards and soldiers squatting around fires . the city was quietprobably never so quiet in its history on that night not a single holdup occurred not a single robbery . but the city duma building was all illuminated . we mounted to the galleried alexander hall hung with its great goldframed redshrouded imperial portraits . about a hundred people were grouped around the platform where skobeliev was speaking . he urged that the committee of public safety be expanded so as to unite all the antibolshevik elements in one huge organisation to be called the committee for salvation of country and revolution . and as we looked on the committee for salvation was formedthat committee which was to develop into the most powerful enemy of the bolsheviki appearing in the next week sometimes under its own partisan name and sometimes as the strictly nonpartisan committee of public safety . . . . dan gotz avkesntiev were there some of the insurgent soviet delegates members of the executive committee of the peasants soviets old prokopovitch and even members of the council of the republicamong whom vinaver and other cadets . lieber cried that the convention of soviets was not a legal convention that the old tsayeekah was still in office . . . . an appeal to the country was drafted . we hailed a cab . where to but when we said smolny the izvoshtchik shook his head . niet said he there are devils . . . . it was only after weary wandering that we found a driver willing to take usand he wanted thirty rubles and stopped two blocks away . the windows of smolny were still ablaze motors came and went and around the stillleaping fires the sentries huddled close eagerly asking everybody the latest news . the corridors were full of hurrying men holloweyed and dirty . in some of the committeerooms people lay sleeping on the floor their guns beside them . in spite of the seceding delegates the hall of meetings was crowded with people roaring like the sea . as we came in kameniev was reading the list of arrested ministers . the name of terestchenko was greeted with thunderous applause shouts of satisfaction laughter rutenburg came in for less and at the mention of paltchinsky a storm of hoots angry cries cheers burst forth . . . . it was announced that tchudnovsky had been appointed commissar of the winter palace . now occurred a dramatic interruption . a big peasant his bearded face convulsed with rage mounted the platform and pounded with his fist on the presidium table . we socialist revolutionaries insist upon the immediate release of the socialist ministers arrested in the winter palace comrades do you know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedom fighting against tyranny of the tsar have been flung into peterpaul prisonthe historical tomb of liberty in the uproar he pounded and yelled . another delegate climbed up beside him and pointed at the presidium . are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sit quietly here while the okhrana of the bolsheviki tortures their leaders trotzky was gesturing for silence . these comrades who are now caught plotting the crushing of the soviets with the adventurer kerenskyis there any reason to handle them with gloves after july 16th and 18th they didnt use much ceremony with us with a triumphant ring in his voice he cried now that the oborontsi and the fainthearted have gone and the whole task of defending and saving the revolution rests on our shoulders it is particularly necessary to workworkwork we have decided to die rather than give up followed him a commissar from tsarskoye selo panting and covered with the mud of his ride . the garrison of tsarskoye selo is on guard at the gates of petrograd ready to defend the soviets and the military revolutionary committee wild cheers . the cycle corps sent from the front has arrived at tsarskoye and the soldiers are now with us they recognise the power of the soviets the necessity of immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial control to the workers . the fifth battalion of cyclists stationed at tsarskoye is ours . . . . then the delegate of the third cycle battalion . in the midst of delirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered three days before from the southwest front to the defence of petrograd . they suspected however the meaning of the order and at the station of peredolsk were met by representatives of the fifth battalion from tsarskoye . a joint meeting was held and it was discovered that among the cyclists not a single man was found willing to shed the blood of his brothers or to support a government of bourgeois and landowners kapelinski for the mensheviki internationalists proposed to elect a special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war . there isnt any peaceful solution bellowed the crowed . victory is the only solution the vote was overwhelmingly against and the mensheviki internationalists left the congress in a whirlwind of jocular insults . there was no longer any panic fear . . . . kameniev from the platform shouted after them the mensheviki internationalists claimed emergency for the question of a peaceful solution but they always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favour of declarations of factions which wanted to leave the congress . it is evident finished kameniev that the withdrawal of all these renegades was decided upon beforehand the assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions and proceed to the appeal to the workers soldiers and peasants of all russia to workers soldiers and peasants the second allrussian congress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputies has opened . it represents the great majority of the soviets . there are also a number of peasant deputies . based upon the will of the great majority of the workers soldiers and peasants based upon the triumphant uprising of the petrograd workmen and soldiers the congress assumes the power . the provisional government is deposed . most of the members of the provisional government are already arrested . the soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democratic peace to all nations and an immediate truce on all fronts . it will assure the free transfer of landlord crown and monastery lands to the land committees defend the soldiers rights enforcing a complete democratisation of the army establish workers control over production ensure the convocation of the constituent assembly at the proper date take means to supply bread to the cities and articles of first necessity to the villages and secure to all nationalities living in russia a real right to independent existence . the congress resolves that all local power shall be transferred to the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies which must enforce revolutionary order . the congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchful and steadfast . the congress of soviets is sure that the revolutionary army will know how to defend the revolution against all attacks of imperialism until the new government shall have brought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it will directly propose to all nations . the new government will take all necessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionary army by means of a determined policy of requisition and taxation of the propertied classes and also to improve the situation of soldiers families . the kornilovitzkerensky kaledin and others are endeavouring to lead troops against petrograd . several regiments deceived by kerensky have sided with the insurgent people . soldiers make active resistance to the kornilovitzkerensky be on guard railway men stop all trooptrains being sent by kerensky against petrograd soldiers workers clerical employees the destiny of the revolution and democratic peace is in your hands long live the revolution the allrussian congress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputies . delegates from the peasants soviets . it was exactly 517 a .m . when krylenko staggering with fatigue climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand . comrades from the northern front . the twelfth army sends greetings to the congress of soviets announcing the formation of a military revolutionary committee which has taken over the command of the northern front pandemonium men weeping embracing each other . general tchermissov has recognised the committeecommissar of the provisional government voitinsky has resigned so . lenin and the petrograd workers had decided on insurrection the petrograd soviet had overthrown the provisional government and thrust the coup detat upon the congress of soviets . now there was all great russia to winand then the world would russia follow and rise and the worldwhat of it would the peoples answer and rise a red worldtide although it was six in the morning night was yet heavy and chill . there was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silent streets dimming the watchfires the shadow of a terrible dawn greyrising over russia . . . . chapter v plunging ahead thursday november 8th . day broke on a city in the wildest excitement and confusion a whole nation having up in long hissing swells of storm . superficially all was quiet hundreds of thousands of people retired at a prudent hour got up early and went to work . in petrograd the streetcars were running the stores and restaurants open theatres going an exhibition of paintings advertised . . . . all the complex routine of common lifehumdrum even in wartimeproceeded as usual . nothing is so astounding as the vitality of the social organismhow it persists feeding itself clothing itself amusing itself in the face of the worst calamities . . . . the air was full of rumours about kerensky who was said to have raised the front and to be leading a great army against the capital . volia naroda published a prikaz launched by him at pskov the disorders caused by the insane attempt of the bolsheviki place the country on the verge of a precipice and demand the effort of our entire will our courage and the devotion of every one of us to win through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing . . . . until the declaration of the composition of the new governmentif one is formedevery one ought to remain at his post and fulfil his duty toward bleeding russia . it must be remembered that the least interference with existing army organisations can bring on irreparable misfortunes by opening the front to the enemy . therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale of the troops by assuring complete order and the preservation of the army from new shocks and by maintaining absolute confidence between officers and their subordinates . i order all the chiefs and commissars in the name of the safety of the country to stay at their posts as i myself retain the post of supreme commander until the provisional government of the republic shall declare its will . . . . in answer this placard on all the walls from the allrussian congress of soviets the exministers konovalov kishkin terestchenko maliantovitch nikitin and others have been arrested by the military revolutionary committee . kerensky has fled . all army organisations are ordered to take every measure for the immediate arrest of kerensky and his conveyance to petrograd . all assistance given to kerensky will be punished as a serious crime against the state . with brakes released the military revolutionary committee whirled throwing off orders appeals decrees like sparks . see app . v sect . 1 . . . kornilov was ordered brought to petrograd . members of the peasant land committees imprisoned by the provisional government were declared free . capital punishment in the army was abolished . government employees were ordered to continue their work and threatened with severe penalties if they refused . all pillage disorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of death . temporary commissars were appointed to the various ministries foreign affairs vuritsky and trotzky interior and justice rykov labor shliapnikov finance menzhinsky public welfare madame kollontai commerce ways and communications riazanov navy the sailor korbir posts and telegraphs spiro theatres muraviov state printing office gherbychev for the city of petrograd lieutenant nesterov for the northern front pozern . . . . to the army appeal to set up military revolutionary committees . to the railway workers to maintain order especially not to delay the transport of food to the cities and the front . . . . in return they were promised representation in the ministry of ways and communications . cossack brothers said one proclamation . you are being led against petrograd . they want to force you into battle with the revolutionary workers and soldiers of the capital . do not believe a word that is said by our common enemies the landowners and the capitalists . at our congress are represented all the conscious organisations of workers soldiers and peasants of russia . the congress wishes also to welcome into its midst the workercossacks . the generals of the black band henchmen of the landowners of nicolai the cruel are our enemies . they tell you that the soviets wish to confiscate the lands of the cossacks . this is a lie . it is only from the great cossack landlords that the revolution will confiscate the land to give it to the people . organise soviets of cossacks deputies join with the soviets of workers and soldiers deputies show the black band that you are not traitors to the people and that you do not wish to be cursed by the whole of revolutionary russia . . . cossack brothers execute no orders of the enemies of the people . send your delegates to petrograd to talk it over with us . . . . the cossacks of the petrograd garrison to their honour have not justified the hope of the peoples enemies . . . . cossack brothers the allrussian congress of soviets extends to you a fraternal hand . long live the brotherhood of the cossacks with the soldiers workers and peasants of all russia on the other side what a storm of proclamations posted up handbills scattered everywhere newspapersscreaming and cursing and prophesying evil . now raged the battle of the printing pressall other weapons being in the hands of the soviets . first the appeal of the committee for salvation of country and revolution flung broadcast over russia and europe to the citizens of the russian republic contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses on november 7th the bolsheviki of petrograd criminally arrested part of the provisional government dispersed the council of the republic and proclaimed an illegal power . such violence committed against the government of revolutionary russia at the moment of its greatest external danger is an indescribable crime against the fatherland . the insurrection of the bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the cause of national defence and postpones immeasurably the moment of peace so greatly desired . civil war begun by the bolsheviki threatens to deliver the country to the horrors of anarchy and counterrevolution and cause the failure of the constituent assembly which must affirm the republican rgime and transmit to the people forever their right to the land . preserving the continuity of the only legal governmental power the committee for salvation of country and revolution established on the night of november 7th takes the initiative in forming a new provisional government which basing itself on the forces of democracy will conduct the country to the constituent assembly and save it from anarchy and counterrevolution . the committee for salvation summons you citizens to refuse to recognise the power of violence . do not obey its orders rise for the defence of the country and revolution support the committee for salvation signed by the council of the russian republic the municipal duma of petrograd the tsayeekah first congress the executive committee of the peasants soviets and from the congress itself the front group the factions of socialist revolutionaries mensheviki populist socialists unified social democrats and the group yedinstvo . then posters from the socialist revolutionary party the mensheviki oborontsi peasants soviets again from the central army committee the tsentroflot . . . . . . . famine will crush petrograd they cried . the german armies will trample on our liberty . black hundred pogroms will spread over russia if we allconscious workers soldiers citizensdo not unite . . . . do not trust the promises of the bolsheviki the promise of immediate peaceis a lie the promise of breada hoax the promise of landa fairy tale . . . they were all in this manner . comrades you have been basely and cruelly deceived the seizure of power has been accomplished by the bolsheviki alone . . . . they concealed their plot from the other socialist parties composing the soviet . . . . you have been promised land and freedom but the counterrevolution will profit by the anarchy called forth by the bolsheviki and will deprive you of land and freedom . . . . the newspapers were as violent . our duty said the dielo naroda is to unmask these traitors to the workingclass . our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mount guard over the cause of the revolution . . . izviestia for the last time speaking in the name of the old tsayeekah threatened awful retribution . as for the congress of soviets we affirm that there has been no congress of soviets we affirm that it was merely a private conference of the bolshevik faction and in that case they have no right to cancel the powers of the tsayeekah . . . . novaya zhizn while pleading for a new government that should unite all the socialist parties criticised severely the action of the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki in quitting the congress and pointed out that the bolshevik insurrection meant one thing very clearly that all illusions about coalition with the bourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain . . . rabotchi put blossomed out as pravda lenins newspaper which had been suppressed in july . it crowed bristling workers soldiers peasants in march you struck down the tyranny of the clique of nobles . yesterday you struck down the tyranny of the bourgeois gang . . . . the first task now is to guard the approaches to petrograd . the second is definitely to disarm the counterrevolutionary elements of petrograd . the third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power and assure the realisation of the popular programme . . . what few cadet organs appeared and the bourgeoisie generally adopted a detached ironical attitude toward the whole business a sort of contemptuous itoldyouso to the other parties . influential cadets were to be seen hovering around the municipal duma and on the outskirts of the committee for salvation . other than that the bourgeoisie lay low biding its hourwhich could not far off . that the bolsheviki would remain in power longer than three days never occurred to anybodyexcept perhaps to lenin trotzky the petrograd workers and the simpler soldiers . . . . in the high amphitheatrical nicolai hall that afternoon i saw the duma sitting in permanence tempestuous grouping around it all the forces of opposition . the old mayer schreider majestic with his white hair and beard was describing his visit to smolny the night before to protest in the name of the municipal selfgovernment . the duma being the only existing legal government in the city elected by equal direct and secret suffrage would not recognise the new power he had told trotzky . and trotzky had answered there is a constitutional remedy for that . the duma can be dissolved and reelected . . . . at this report there was a furious outcry . if one recognises a government by bayonet continued the old man addressing the duma well we have one but i consider legitimate only a government recognised by the majority and not one created by the usurpation of a minority wild applause on all benches except those of the bolsheviki . amid renewed tumult the mayor announced that the bolsheviki already were violating municipal autonomy by appointing commissars in many departments . the bolshevik speaker shouted trying to make himself heard that the decision of the congress of soviets meant that all russia backed up the action of the bolsheviki . you he cried . you are not the real representative of the people of petrograd shrieks of insult insult the old mayor with dignity reminded him that the duma was elected by the freest possible popular vote . yes he answered but that was a long time agolike the tsayeekahlike the army committee . there has been no new congress of soviets they yelled at him . the bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest of counterrevolution uproar . and we demand a reelection of the duma . . . . whereupon the bolsheviki left the chamber followed by cries of german agents down with the traitors shingariov cadet then demanded that all municipal functionaries who had consented to be commissars of the military revolutionary committee be discharged from their position and indicted . schreider was on his feet putting a motion to the effect that the duma protested against the menace of the bolsheviki to dissolve it and as the legal representative of the population it would refuse to leave its post . outside the alexander hall was crowded for the meeting of the committee for salvation and skobeliev was again speaking . never yet he said was the fate of the revolution so acute never yet did the question of the existence of the russian state excite so much anxiety never yet did history put so harshly and categorically the questionis russia to be or not to be the great hour for the salvation of the revolution has arrived and in consciousness thereof we observe the close union of the live forces of the revolutionary democracy by whose organised will a centre for the salvation of the country and the revolution has already been created . . . . and much of the same sort . we shall die sooner than surrender our post amid violent applause it was announced that the union of railway workers had joined the committee for salvation . a few moments later the post and telegraph employees came in then some mensheviki internationalists entered the hall to cheers . the railway men said they did not recognise the bolsheviki and had taken the entire railroad apparatus into their own hands refusing to entrust it to any usurpatory power . the telegraphers delegate declared that the operators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long as the bolshevik commissar was in the office . the postmen would not deliver or accept mail at smolny . . . . all the smolny telephones were cut off . with great glee it was reported how uritzky had gone to the ministry of foreign affairs to demand the secret treaties and how neratov had put him out . the government employees were all stopping work . . . . it was warwar deliberately planned russian fashion war by strike and sabotage . as we sat there the chairman read a list of names and assignments soandso was to make the round of the ministries another was to visit the banks some ten or twelve were to work the barracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutralrussian soldiers do not shed the blood of your brothers a committee was to go and confer with kerensky still others were despatched to provincial cities to form branches of the committee for salvation and link together the antibolshevik elements . the crowd was in high spirits . these bolsheviki will try to dictate to the intelligentzia well show them . . . nothing could be more striking than the contrast between this assemblage and the congress of soviets . there great masses of shabby soldiers grimy workmen peasantspoor men bent and scarred in the brute struggle for existence here the menshevik and social revolutionary leadersavksentievs dans liebersthe former socialist ministersskobelievs tchernovsrubbed shoulders with cadets like oily shatsky sleek vinaver with journalists students intellectuals of almost all camps . this duma crowd was wellfed welldressed i did not see more than three proletarians among them all . . . . news came . kornilovs faithful tekhintsi had slaughtered his see notes and explanations guards at bykhov and he had escaped . kaledin was marching north . . . . the soviet of moscow had set up a military revolutionary committee and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possession of the arsenal so that the workers might be armed . with these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours distortions and plain lies . for instance an intelligent young cadet formerly private secretary to miliukov and then to terestchenko drew us aside and told us all about the taking of the winter palace . the bolsheviki were led by german and austrian officers he affirmed . is that so we replied politely . how do you know a friend of mine was there and saw them . how could he tell they were german officers oh because they wore german uniforms there were hundreds of such absurd tales and they were not only solemnly published by the antibolshevik press but believed by the most unlikely personssocialist revolutionaries and mensheviki who had always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts . . . . but more serious were the stories of bolshevik violence and terrorism . for example it was said printed that the red guards had not only thoroughly looted the winter palace but that they had massacred the yunkers after disarming them had killed some of the ministers in cold blood and as for the woman soldiers most of them had been violated and many had committed suicide because of the tortures they had gone through . . . . all these stories were swallowed whole by the crowd in the duma . and worse still the mothers and fathers of the students and of the women read these frightful details often accompanied by lists of names and toward nightfall the duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens . . . . a typical case is that of prince tumanov whose body it was announced in many newspapers had been found floating in the moika canal . a few hours later this was denied by the princes family who added that the prince was under arrest so the press identified the dead man as general demissov . the general having also come to life we investigated and could find no trace of any body found whatever . . . . as we left the duma building two boy scouts were distributing handbills see app . v sect . 2 to the enormous crowd which blocked the nevsky in front of the doora crowd composed almost entirely of business men shopkeepers tchinouniki clerks . one read from the municipal duma the municipal duma in its meeting of october 26th in view of the events of the day decrees to announce the inviolability of private dwellings . through the house committees it calls upon the population of the town of petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attempts to enter by force private apartments not stopping at the use of arms in the interests of the selfdefence of citizens . up on the corner of the liteiny five or six red guards and a couple of sailors had surrounded a newsdealer and were demanding that he hand over his copies of the menshevik rabotchaya gazeta workers gazette . angrily he shouted at them shaking his fist as one of the sailors tore the papers from his stand . an ugly crowd had gathered around abusing the patrol . one little workman kept explaining doggedly to the people and the newsdealer over and over again it has kerenskys proclamation in it . it says we killed russian people . it will make bloodshed . . . . smolny was tenser than ever if that were possible . the same running men in the dark corridors squads of workers with rifles leaders with bulging portfolios arguing explaining giving orders as they hurried anxiously along surrounded by friends and lieutenants . men literally out of themselves living prodigies of sleeplessness and workmen unshaven filthy with burning eyes who drove upon their fixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation . so much they had to do so much take over the government organise the city keep the garrison loyal fight the duma and the committee for salvation keep out the germans prepare to do battle with kerensky inform the provinces what had happened propagandise from archangel to vladivostok . . . . government and municipal employees refusing to obey their commissars post and telegraph refusing them communication railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains kerensky coming the garrison not altogether to be trusted the cossacks waiting to come out . . . . against them not only the organised bourgeoisie but all the other socialist parties except the left socialist revolutionaries a few mensheviki internationalists and the social democrat internationalists and even they undecided whether to stand by or not . with them it is true the workers and the soldiermassesthe peasants an unknown quantitybut after all the bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained and educated men . . . . riazanov was coming up the front steps explaining in a sort of humorous panic that he commissar of commerce knew nothing whatever of business . in the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in the corner in a goatskin cape and clothes which had beeni was going to say slept in but of course he hadnt sleptand a three days growth of beard . he was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope and biting his pencil meanwhile . this was menzhinsky commissar of finance whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in a french bank . . . . and these four halfrunning down the hall from the office of the military revolutionary committee and scribbling on bits of paper as they runthese were commissars despatched to the four corners of russia to carry the news argue or fightwith whatever arguments or weapons came to hand . . . . the congress was to meet at one oclock and long since the great meetinghall had filled but by seven there was yet no sign of the presidium . . . . the bolshevik and left social revolutionary factions were in session in their own rooms . all the livelong afternoon lenin and trotzky had fought against compromise . a considerable part of the bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create a joint allsocialist government . we cant hold on they cried . too much is against us . we havent got the men . we will be isolated and the whole thing will fall . so kameniev riazanov and others . but lenin with trotzky beside him stood firm as a rock . let the compromisers accept our programme and they can come in we wont give way an inch . if there are comrades here who havent the courage and the will to dare what we dare let them leave with the rest of the cowards and conciliators backed by the workers and soldiers we shall go on . at five minutes past seven came word from the left socialist revolutionaries to say that they would remain in the military revolutionary committee . see said lenin . they are following a little later as we sat at the press table in the big hall an anarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to me that we go and find out what had become of the presidium . there was nobody in the tsayeekah office nor in the bureau of the petrograd soviet . from room to room we wandered through vast smolny . nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find the governing body of the congress . as we went my companion described his ancient revolutionary activities his long and pleasant exile in france . . . . as for the bolsheviki he confided to me that they were common rude ignorant persons without aesthetic sensibilities . he was a real specimen of the russian intelligentzia . . . . so he came at last to room 17 office of the military revolutionary committee and stood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going . the door opened and out shot a squat flatfaced man in a uniform without insignia who seemed to be smilingwhich smile after a minute one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue . it was krylenko . my friend who was a dapper civilizedlooking young man gave a cry of pleasure and stepped forward . nicolai vasilievitch he said holding out his hand . dont you remember me comrade we were in prison together . krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight . why yes he answered finally looking the other up and down with an expression of great friendliness . you are s . zdrastvuitye they kissed . what are you doing in all this he waved his arm around . oh iam just looking on . . . . you seem very successful . yes replied krylenko with a sort of doggedness the proletarian revolution is a great success . he laughed . perhapsperhaps however well meet in prison again when we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with his explanations . you see iam a follower of kropotkin . to us the revolution is a great failure it has not aroused the patriotism of the masses . of course that only proves that the people are not ready for revolution . . . . it was just 8 .40 when a thundering wave of cheers announced the entrance of the presidium with leningreat leninamong them . a short stocky figure with a big head set down in his shoulders bald and bulging . little eyes a snubbish nose wide generous mouth and heavy chin cleanshaven now but already beginning to bristle with the wellknown beard of his past and future . dressed in shabby clothes his trousers much too long for him . unimpressive to be the idol of a mob loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been . a strange popular leadera leader purely by virtue of intellect colourless humourless uncompromising and detached without picturesque idiosyncrasiesbut with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms of analysing a concrete situation . and combined with shrewdness the greatest intellectual audacity . kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the military revolutionary committee abolition of capital punishment in the army restoration of the free right of propaganda release of officers and soldiers arrested for political crimes orders to arrest kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in private storehouses . . . . tremendous applause . again the representative of the bund . the uncompromising attitude of the bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the revolution therefore the bund delegates must refuse any longer to sit in the congress . cries from the audience we thought you walked out last night how many times are you going to walk out then the representative of the mensheviki internationalists . shouts what you here still the speaker explained that only part of the mensheviki internationalists left the congress the rest were going to stay we consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the revolution to transfer the power to the sovietsinterruptionsbut we feel it our duty to remain in the congress and vote against the transfer here other speakers followed apparently without any order . a delegate of the coalminers of the don basin called upon the congress to take measures against kaledin who might cut off coal and food from the capital . several soldiers just arrived from the front brought the enthusiastic greetings of their regiments . . . . now lenin gripping the edge of the reading stand letting his little winking eyes travel over the crowd as he stood there waiting apparently oblivious to the longrolling ovation which lasted several minutes . when it finished he said simply we shall now proceed to construct the socialist order again that overwhelming human roar . the first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realise peace . . . . we shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerent countries upon the basis of the soviet termsno annexations no indemnities and the right of selfdetermination of peoples . at the same time according to our promise we shall publish and repudiate the secret treaties . . . . the question of war and peace is so clear that i think that i may without preamble read the project of a proclamation to the peoples of all the belligerent countries . . . . his great mouth seeming to smile opened wide as he spoke his voice was hoarsenot unpleasantly so but as if it had hardened that way after years and years of speakingand went on monotonously with the effect of being able to go on forever . . . . for emphasis he bent forward slightly . no gestures . and before him a thousand simple faces looking up in intent adoration . proclamation to the peoples and governments of all the belligerent nations . the workers and peasants government created by the revolution of november 6th and 7th and based on the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies proposes to all the belligerent peoples and to their governments to begin immediately negotiations for a just and democratic peace . the government means by a just and democratic peace which is desired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouring classes exhausted and depleted by the warthat peace which the russian workers and peasants after having struck down the tsarist monarchy have not ceased to demand categoricallyimmediate peace without annexations that is to say without conquest of foreign territory without forcible annexation of other nationalities and without indemnities . the government of russia proposes to all the belligerent peoples immediately to conclude such a peace by showing themselves willing to enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such a peace at once without the slightest delay before the definitive ratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorised assemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities . by annexation or conquest of foreign territory the government meansconformably to the conception of democratic rights in general and the rights of the workingclass in particularall union to a great and strong state of a small or weak nationality without the voluntary clear and precise expression of its consent and desire whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force was accomplished whatever be the degree civilisation of the nation annexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of another state no matter if that nation be in europe or in the far countries across the sea . if any nation is retained by force within the limits of another state if in spite of the desire expressed by it it matters little if that desire be expressed by the press by popular meetings decisions of political parties or by disorders and riots against national oppression that nation is not given the right of deciding by free votewithout the slightest constraint after the complete departure of the armed forces of the nation which has annexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in generalthe form of its national and political organisation such a union constitutes an annexationthat is to say conquest and an act of violence . to continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nations to divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities is considered by the government the greatest possible crime against humanity and the government solemnly proclaims its decision to sign a treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the above conditions equally fair for all nationalities without exception . the government abolishes secret diplomacy expressing before the whole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations in the light of day before the people and will proceed immediately to the full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concluded by the government of landowners and capitalists from march until november 7th 1917 . all the clauses of the secret treaties which as occur in a majority of cases have for their object to procure advantages and privileges for russian capitalists to maintain or augment the annexations of the russian imperialists are denounced by the government immediately and without discussion . in proposing to all governments and all peoples to engage in public negotiations for peace the government declares itself ready to carry on these negotiations by telegraph by post or by pourparlers between the representatives of the different countries or at a conference of these representatives . to facilitate these pourparlers the government appoints its authorised representatives in the neutral countries . the government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice at the same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last three months during which time it is perfectly possible not only to hold the necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all the nations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war or forced to take part in it but also to convoke authorised assemblies of representatives of the people of all countries for the purpose of the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace . in addressing this offer of peace to the governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries the provisional workers and peasants government of russia addresses equally and in particular the conscious workers of the three nations most devoted to humanity and the three most important nations among those taking part in the present warengland france and germany . the workers of these countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause of progress and of socialism . the splendid examples of the chartist movement in england the series of revolutions of worldwide historical significance accomplished by the french proletariatand finally in germany the historic struggle against the laws of exception an example for the workers of the whole world of prolonged and stubborn action and the creation of the formidable organisations of german proletariansall these models of proletarian heroism these monuments of history are for us a sure guarantee that the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposed upon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences of war and that these workers by decisive energetic and continued action will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the cause of peaceand at the same time the cause of the liberation of the exploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation . when the grave thunder of applause had died away lenin spoke again we propose to the congress to ratify this declaration . we address ourselves to the governments as well as to the peoples for a declaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of the belligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace . the conditions of peace drawn up during the armistice will be ratified by the constituent assembly . in fixing the duration of the armistice at three months we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest as possible after this bloody extermination and ample time for them to elect their representatives . this proposal of peace will meet with resistance on the part of the imperialist governmentswe dont fool ourselves on that score . but we hope that revolution will soon break out in all the belligerent countries that is why we address ourselves especially to the workers of france england and germany . . . . the revolution of november 6th and 7th he ended has opened the era of the social revolution . . . . the labour movement in the name of peace and socialism shall win and fulfil its destiny . . . . there was something quiet and powerful in all this which stirred the souls of men . it was understandable why people believed when lenin spoke . . . . by crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives of political factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and that speakers should be limited to fifteen minutes . first karelin for the left socialist revolutionaries . our faction had no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of the proclamation it is a private document of the bolsheviki . but we will vote for it because we agree with its spirit . . . . for the social democrats internationalists kramarov long stoopshouldered and nearsighteddestined to achieve some notoriety as the clown of the opposition . only a government composed of all the socialist parties he said could possess the authority to take such important action . if a socialist coalition were formed his faction would support the entire programme if not only part of it . as for the proclamation the internationalists were in thorough accord with its main points . . . . then one after another amid rising enthusiasm ukrainean social democracy support lithuanian social democracy support populist socialists support polish social democracy support polish socialists supportbut would prefer a socialist coalition lettish social democracy support . . . . something was kindled in these men . one spoke of the coming worldrevolution of which we are the advanceguard another of the new age of brotherhood when all the peoples will become one great family . . . . an individual member claimed the floor . there is contradiction here he said . first you offer peace without annexations and indemnities and then you say you will consider all peace offers . to consider means to accept . . . . lenin was on his feet . we want a just peace but we are not afraid of a revolutionary war . . . . probably the imperialist governments will not answer our appealbut we shall not issue an ultimatum to which it will be easy to say no . . . . if the german proletariat realises that we are ready to consider all offers of peace that will perhaps be the last drop which overflows the bowlrevolution will break out in germany . . . . we consent to examine all conditions of peace but that doesnt mean that we shall accept them . . . . for some of our terms we shall fight to the endbut possibly for others will find it impossible to continue the war . . . . above all we want to finish the war . . . . it was exactly 1035 when kameniev asked all in favour of the proclamation to hold up their cards . one delegate dared to raise his hand against but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought it swiftly down . . . . unanimous . suddenly by common impulse we found ourselves on our feet mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the internationale . a grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child . alexandra kollontai rapidly winked the tears back . the immense sound rolled through the hall burst windows and doors and seared into the quiet sky . the war is ended the war is ended said a young workman near me his face shining . and when it was over as we stood there in a kind of awkward hush some one in the back of the room ck of the room shouted comrades let us remember those who have died for liberty so we began to sing the funeral march that slow melancholy and yet triumphant chant so russian and so moving . the internationale is an alien air after all . the funeral march seemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat in this hall building from their obscure visions a new russiaand perhaps more . you fell in the fatal fight for the liberty of the people for the honour of the people . . . . you gave up your lives and everything dear to you you suffered in horrible prisons you went to exile in chains . . . . without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignore your suffering brothers because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword . . . . the time will come when your surrendered life will count that time is near when tyranny falls the people will rise great and free farewell brothers you chose a noble path you are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and to suffer . . . . farewell brothers you chose a noble path at your grave we swear to fight to work for freedom and the peoples happiness . . . . for this did they lie there the martyrs of march in their cold brotherhood grave on mars field for this thousands and tens of thousands had died in the prisons in exile in siberian mines . it had not come as they expected it would come nor as the intelligentzia desired it but it had comerough strong impatient of formulas contemptuous of sentimentalism real . . . . lenin was reading the decree on land 1 . all private ownership of land is abolished immediately without compensation . 2 . all landowners estates and all lands belonging to the crown to monasteries church lands with all their live stock and inventoried property buildings and all appurtenances are transferred to the disposition of the township land committees and the district soviets of peasants deputies until the constituent assembly meets . 3 . any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which from now on belongs to the whole people is regarded as a serious crime punishable by the revolutionary tribunals . the district soviets of peasants deputies shall take all necessary measures for the observance of the strictest order during the taking over of the landowners estates for the determination of the dimensions of the plots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation for the drawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property and for the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farming property on the land with all buildings implements cattle supplies of products etc . passing into the hands of the people . 4 . for guidance during the realisation of the great land reforms until their final resolution by the constituent assembly shall serve the following peasant nakaz see app . v sect . 3 instructions drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant nakazi by the editorial board of the izviestia of the allrussian soviet of peasants deputies and published in no .88 of said izviestia petrograd no .88 august 19th 1917 . the lands of peasants and of cossacks serving in the army shall not be confiscated . this is not explained lenin the project of former minister tchernov who spoke of erecting a framework and tried to realise reforms from above . from below on the spot will be decided the questions of division of the land . the amount of land received by each peasant will vary according to the locality . . . . under the provisional government the pomieshtchiki flatly refused to obey the orders of the land committeesthose land committees projected by lvov brought into existence by shingariov and administered by kerensky before the debates could begin a man forced his way violently through the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform . it was pianikh member of the executive committee of the peasants soviets and he was mad clean through . the executive committee of the allrussian soviets of peasants deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades the ministers salazkin and mazlov he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd we demand their instant release they are now in peterpaul fortress . we must have immediate action there is not a moment to lose another followed him a soldier with disordered beard and flaming eyes . you sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants chosen representatives i tell you he raised his fist if one hair of their heads is harmed youll have a revolt on your hands the crowd stirred confusedly . then up rose trotzky calm and venomous conscious of power greeted with a roar . yesterday the military revolutionary committee decided to release the socialist revolutionary and menshevik ministers mazlov salazkin gvozdov and maliantovitchon principle . that they are still in peterpaul is only because we have had so much to do . . . . they will however be detained at their homes under arrest until we have investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts of kerensky during the kornilov affair never shouted pianikh in any revolution have such things been seen as go on here you are mistaken responded trotzky . such things have been seen even in this revolution . hundreds of our comrades were arrested in the july days . . . . when comrade kollontai was released from prison by the doctors orders avksentiev placed at her door two former agents of the tsars secret police the peasants withdrew muttering followed by ironical hoots . the representative of the left socialist revolutionaries spoke on the land decree . while agreeing in principle his faction could not vote on the question until after discussion . the peasants soviets should be consulted . . . . the mensheviki internationalists too insisted on a party caucus . then the leader of the maximalists the anarchist wing of the peasants we must do honour to a political party which puts such an act into effect the first day without jawing about it a typical peasant was in the tribune long hair boots and sheepskin coat bowing to all corners of the hall . i wish you well comrades and citizens he said . there are some cadets walking around outside . you arrested our socialist peasantswhy not arrest them this was the signal for a debate of excited peasants . it was precisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before . here were the real proletarians of the land . . . . those members of our executive committee avksentiev and the rest whom we thought were the peasants protectorsthey are only cadets too arrest them arrest them another who are these pianikhs these avksentievs they are not peasants at all they only wag their tails how the crowd rose to them recognising brothers the left socialist revolutionaries proposed a halfhour intermission . as the delegates streamed out lenin stood up in his place . we must not lose time comrades news allimportant to russia must be on the press tomorrow morning . no delay and above the hot discussion argument shuffling of feet could be heard the voice of an emissary of the military revolutionary committee crying fifteen agitators wanted in room 17 at once to go to the fronthellip it was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates came straggling back the presidium mounted the platform and the session recommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment after regiment announcing their adhesion to the military revolutionary committee . in leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum . a delegate from the russian troops on the macedonian front spoke bitterly of their situation . we suffer there more from the friendship of our allies than from the enemy he said . representatives of the tenth and twelfth armies just arrived in hot haste reported we support you with all our strength a peasantsoldier protested against the release of the traitor socialists mazlov and salazkin as for the executive committee of the peasants soviets it should be arrested en massehere was real revolutionary talk . . . . a deputy from the russian army in persia declared he was instructed to demand all power to the soviets . . . . a ukrainean officer speaking in his native tongue there is no nationalism in this crisis . . . . da zdravstvuyet the proletarian dictatorship of all lands such a deluge of high and hot thoughts that surely russia would never again be dumb kameniev remarked that the antibolshevik forces were trying to stir up disorders everywhere and read an appeal of the congress to all the soviets of russia the allrussian congress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputies including some peasants deputies calls upon the local soviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose all counterrevolutionary antijewish action and all pogroms whatever they may be . the honour of the workers peasants and soldiers revolution demands that no pogrom be tolerated . the red guard of petrograd the revolutionary garrison and the sailors have maintained complete order in the capital . workers soldiers and peasants you should follow everywhere the example of the workers and soldiers of petrograd . comrade soldiers and cossacks on us falls the duty of assuring real revolutionary order . all revolutionary russia and the entire world have their eyes on us . . . . at two oclock the land decree was put to vote with only one against and the peasant delegates wild with joy . . . . so plunged the bolsheviki ahead irresistible overriding hesitation and oppositionthe only people in russia who had a definite programme of action while the others talked for eight long months . now arose a soldier gaunt ragged and eloquent to protest against the clause of the nakaz tending to deprive military deserters from a share in village land allotments . bawled at and hissed at first his simple moving speech finally made silence . forced against his will into the butchery of the trenches he cried which you yourselves in the peace decree have voted senseless as well as horrible he greeted the revolution with hope of peace and freedom . peace the government of kerensky forced him again to go forward into galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered to his pleas for peace terestchenko simply laughed . . . . freedom under kerensky he found his committees suppressed his newspapers cut off his party speakers put in prison . . . . at home in his village the landlords were defying his land committees jailing his comrades . . . . in petrograd the bourgeoisie in alliance with the germans were sabotaging the food and ammunition for the army . . . . he was without boots or clothes . . . . who forced him to desert the government of kerensky which you have overthrown at the end there was applause . but another soldier hotly denounced it the government of kerensky is not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work like desertion deserters are scoundrels who run away home and leave their comrades to die in the trenches alone every deserter is a traitor and should be punished . . . . uproar shouts of do volno teesche kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to the government for decision . see app . v sect . 4 at 2 .30 a . m . fell a tense hush . kameniev was reading the decree of the constitution of power until the meeting of the constituent assembly a provisional workers and peasants government is formed which shall be named the council of peoples commissars . see app . v sect . 5 the administration of the different branches of state activity shall be intrusted to commissions whose composition shall be regulated to ensure the carrying out of the programme of the congress in close union with the massorganisations of workingmen workingwomen sailors soldiers peasants and clerical employees . the governmental power is vested in a collegium made up of the chairmen of these commissions that is to say the council of peoples commissars . control over the activities of the peoples commissars and the right to replace them shall belong to the allrussian congress of soviets of workers peasants and soldiers deputies and its central executive committee . still silence as he read the list of commissars bursts of applause after each name lenins and trotzkys especially . president of the council vladimir ulianov lenin interior a . e . rykov agriculture v . p . miliutin labour a . g .

nationalities i . v . djougashvili stalin railroads to be filled later . there were bayonets at the edges of the room bayonets pricking up among the delegates the military revolutionary committee was arming everybody bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle with kerensky the sound of whose trumpets came up the southwest wind . . . . in the meanwhile nobody went home on the contrary hundreds of newcomers filtered in filling the great room solid with sternfaced soldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours indefatigably intent . the air was thick with cigarette smoke and human breathing and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat . avilov of the staff of novaya zhizn was speaking in the name of the social democrat internationalists and the remnant of the mensheviki internationalists avilov with his young intelligent face looking out of place in his smart frockcoat . we must ask ourselves where we are going . . . . the ease with which the coalition government was upset cannot be explained by the strength of the left wing of the democracy but only by the incapacity of the government to give the people peace and bread . and the left wing cannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions . . . . can it give bread to the people grain is scarce . the majority of the peasants will not be with you for you cannot give them the machinery they need . fuel and other primary necessities are almost impossible to procure . . . . as for peace that will be even more difficult . the allies refused to talk with skobeliev . they will never accept the proposition of a peace conference from you . you will not be recognised either in london and paris or in berlin . . . . you cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of the allied countries because in most countries it is very far from the revolutionary struggle remember the allied democracy was unable even to convoke the stockholm conference . concerning the german social democrats i have just talked with comrade goldenberg one of our delegates to stockholm he was told by the representatives of the extreme left that revolution in germany was impossible during the war . . . . here interruptions began to come thick and fast but avilov kept on . the isolation of russia will fatally result either in the defeat of the russian army by the germans and the patching up of a peace between the austrogerman coalition and the francobritish coalition at the expense of russiaor in a separate peace with germany . i have just learned that the allied ambassadors are preparing to leave and that committees for salvation of country and revolution are forming in all the cities of russia . . . . no one party can conquer these enormous difficulties . the majority of the people supporting a government of socialist coalition can alone accomplish the revolution . . . . he then read the resolution of the two factions recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of the revolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute a government based on the revolutionary democracy organised in the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies recognising moreover that the task of this government is the quickest possible attainment of peace the transfer of the land into the hands of the agrarian committees the organisation of control over industrial production and the convocation of the constituent assembly on the date decided the congress appoints an executive committee to constitute such a government after an agreement with the groups of the democracy which are taking part in the congress . in spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd avilovs cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them . toward the end the cries and hisses died away and when he finished there was even some clapping . karelin followed himalso young fearless whose sincerity no one doubtedfor the left socialist revolutionaries the party of maria spiridonova the party which almost alone followed the bolsheviki and which represented the revolutionary peasants . our party has refused to enter the council of peoples commissars because we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the part of the revolutionary army which left the congress a separation which would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediaries between the bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy . . . . and that is our principal duty at this moment . we cannot sustain any government except a government of socialist coalition . . . . we protest moreover against the tyrannical conduct of the bolsheviki . our commissars have been driven from their posts . our only organ znamia truda banner of labour was forbidden to appear yesterday . . . . the central duma is forming a powerful committee for salvation of country and revolution to fight you . already you are isolated and your government is without the support of a single other democratic group . . . . and now trotzky stood upon the raised tribune confident and dominating with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which was almost a sneer . he spoke in a ringing voice and the great crowd rose to him . these considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party are not new . on the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was also predicted . everybody was against us only a faction of the socialist revolutionaries of the left was with us in the military revolutionary committee . how is it that we were able to overturn the government almost without bloodshed . . . . that fact is the most striking proof that we were not isolated . in reality the provisional government was isolated the democratic parties which march against us were isolated are isolated and forever cut off from the proletariat they speak of the necessity for a coalition . there is only one coalition possiblethe coalition of the workers soldiers and poorest peasants and it is our partys honour to have realised that coalition . . . . what sort of coalition did avilov mean a coalition with those who supported the government of treason to the people coalition doesnt always add to strength . for example could we have organised the insurrection with dan and avksentiev in our ranks roars of laughter . avksentiev gave little bread . will a coalition with the oborontsi furnish more between the peasants and avksentiev who ordered the arrest of the land committees we choose the peasants our revolution will remain the classic revolution of history . . . . they accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democratic parties . but is it we who are to blame or must we as karelin put it blame it on a misunderstanding no comrades . when a party in full tide of revolution still wreathed in powdersmoke comes to say here is the powertake itand when those to whom it is offered go over to the enemy that is not a misunderstanding . . . . that is a declaration of pitiless war . and it isnt we who have declared war . . . . avilov menaces us with failure of our peace effortsif we remain isolated . i repeat i dont see how a coalition with skobeliev or even terestchenko can help us to get peace avilov tries to frighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense . and i answer that in any case if europe continues to be ruled by the imperialist bourgeoisie revolutionary russia will inevitably be lost . . . . there are only two alternatives either the russian revolution will create a revolutionary movement in europe or the european powers will destroy the russian revolution they greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim kindling to the daring of it with the thought of championing mankind . and from that moment there was something conscious and decided about the insurrectionary masses in all their actions which never left them . but on the other side too battle was taking form . kameniev recognised a delegate from the union of railway workers a hardfaced stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility . he threw a bombshell . in the name of the strongest organisation in russia i demand the right to speak and i say to you the vikzhelcharges me to make known the decision of the union concerning the constitution of power . the central committee refuses absolutely to support the bolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the whole democracy of russia immense tumult all over the hall . in 1905 and in the kornilov days the railway workers were the best defenders of the revolution . but you did not invite us to your congress cries it was the old tsayeekah which did not invite you the orator paid no attention . we do not recognise the legality of this congress since the departure of the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum . . . . the union supports the old tsayeekah and declares that the congress has no right to elect a new committee . . . . the power should be a socialist and revolutionary power responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionary democracy . until the constitution of such a power the union of railway workers which refuses to transport counterrevolutionary troops to petrograd at the same time forbids the execution of any order whatever without the consent of the vikzhel . the vikzhel also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroads of russia . at the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abuse which beat upon him . but it was a heavy blowthat could be seen in the concern on the faces of the presidium . kameniev however merely answered that there could be no doubt of the legality of the congress as even the quorum established by the old tsayeekah was exceededin spite of the secession of the mensheviki and socialist revolution arises . . . . then came the vote on the constitution of power which carried the council of peoples commissars into office by an enormous majority . . . . the election of the new tsayeekah the new parliament of the russian republic took barely fifteen minutes . trotzky announced its composition 100 members of which 70 bolsheviki . . . . as for the peasants and the seceding factions places were to be reserved for them . we welcome into the government all parties and groups which will adopt our programme ended trotzky . and thereupon the second allrussian congress of soviets was dissolved so that the members might hurry to their homes in the four corners of russia and tell of the great happenings . . . . it was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors and motormen of the streetcars which the streetrailway workers union always kept waiting at smolny to take the soviet delegates to their homes . in the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than the night before i thought . many looked anxious perhaps they were saying to themselves now we are masters how can we do our will at our apartmenthouse we were held up in the dark by an armed patrol of citizens and carefully examined . the dumas proclamation was doing its work . . . . the landlady heard us come in and stumbled out in a pink silk wrapper . the house committee has again asked that you take your turn on guardduty with the rest of the men she said . whats the reason for this guardduty to protect the house and the women and children . who from robbers and murderers . but suppose there came a commissar from the military revolutionary committee to search for arms oh thats what theyll say they are . . . . and besides whats the difference i solemnly affirmed that the consul had forbidden all american citizens to carry armsespecially in the neighbourhood of the russian intelligentzia . . . . chapter vi the committee for salvation friday november 9th . . . . novotcherkask november 8th . in view of the revolt of the bolsheviki and their attempt to depose the provisional government and to seize the power in petrograd . . . the cossack government declares that it considers these acts criminal and absolutely inadmissible . in consequence the cossacks will lend all their support to the provisional government which is a government of coalition . because of these circumstances and until the return of the provisional government to power and the restoration of order in russia i take upon myself beginning november 7th all the power in that which concerns the region of the don . signed ataman kaledin president of the government of the cossack troops . prikaz of the ministerpresident kerensky dated at gatchina i ministerpresident of the provisional government and supreme commander of all the armed forces of the russian republic declare that i am at the head of regiments from the front who have remained faithful to the fatherland . i order all the troops of the military district of petrograd who through mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors to the country and the revolution to return to their duty without delay . this order shall be read in all regiments battalions and squadrons . signed ministerpresident of the provisional government and supreme commander a . f . kerensky . telegram from kerensky to the general in command of the northern front the town of gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments without bloodshed . detachments of cronstadt sailors and of the semionovsky and ismailovsky regiments gave up their arms without resistance and joined the government troops . i order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible . the military revolutionary committee has ordered its troops to retreat . . . . gatchina about thirty kilometers southwest had fallen during the night . detachments of the two regiments mentionednot the sailorswhile wandering captainless in the neighbourhood had indeed been surrounded by cossacks and given up their arms but it was not true that they had joined the government troops . at this very moment crowds of them bewildered and ashamed were up at smolny trying to explain . they did not think the cossacks were so near . . . . they had tried to argue with the cossacks . . . . apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionary front . the garrisons of all the little towns southward had split hopelessly bitterly into two factionsor three the high command being on the side of kerensky in default of anything stronger the majority of the rank and file with the soviets and the rest unhappily wavering . hastily the military revolutionary committee appointed to command the defence of petrograd an ambitious regular army captain muraviov the same muraviov who had organised the death battalions during the summer and had once been heard to advise the government that it was too lenient with the bolsheviki they must be wiped out . a man of military mind who admired power and audacity perhaps sincerely . . . . beside my door when i came down in the morning were posted two new orders of the military revolutionary committee directing that all shops and stores should open as usual and that all empty rooms and apartments should be put at the disposal of the committee . . . . for thirtysix hours now the bolsheviki had been cut off from provincial russia and the outside world . the railway men and telegraphers refused to transmit their despatches the postmen would not handle their mail . only the government wireless at tsarskoye selo launched halfhourly bulletins and manifestoes to the four corners of heaven the commissars of smolny raced the commissars of the city duma on speeding trains half across the earth and two aeroplanes laden with propaganda fled high up toward the front . . . . but the eddies of insurrection were spreading through russia with a swiftness surpassing any human agency . helsingfors soviet passed resolutions of support kiev bolsheviki captured the arsenal and the telegraph station only to be driven out by delegates to the congress of cossacks which happened to be meeting there in kazan a military revolutionary committee arrested the local garrison staff and the commissar of the provisional government from far krasnoyarsk in siberia came news that the soviets were in control of the municipal institutions at moscow where the situation was aggravated by a great strike of leatherworkers on one side and a threat of general lockout on the other the soviets had voted overwhelmingly to support the action of the bolsheviki in petrograd . . . . already a military revolutionary committee was functioning . everywhere the same thing happened . the common soldiers and the industrial workers supported the soviets by a vast majority the officers yunkers and middle class generally were on the side of the governmentas were the bourgeois cadets and the moderate socialist parties . in all these towns sprang up committees for salvation of country and revolution arming for civil war . . . . vast russia was in a state of solution . as long ago as 1905 the process had begun the march revolution had merely hastened it and giving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order had ended by merely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime . now however the bolsheviki in one night had dissipated it as one blows away smoke . old russia was no more human society flowed molten in primal heat and from the tossing sea of flame was emerging the class struggle stark and pitilessand the fragile slowlycooling crust of new planets . . . . in petrograd sixteen ministries were on strike led by the ministries of labour and of suppliesthe only two created by the allsocialist government of august . if ever men stood alone the handful of bolsheviki apparently stood alone that grey chill morning with all storms towering over them . see app . vi sect . 1 back against the wall the military revolutionary committee struckfor its life . de laudace encore de laudace et toujours de laudace . . . . at five in the morning the red guards entered the printing office of the city government confiscated thousands of copies of the appealprotest of the duma and suppressed the official municipal organthe viestnik gorodskovo samoupravleniya bulletin of the municipal selfgovernment . all the bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses even the golos soldata journal of the old tsayeekahwhich however changing its name to soldatski golos appeared in an edition of a hundred thousand copies bellowing rage and defiance the men who began their stroke of treachery in the night who have suppressed the newspapers will not keep the country in ignorance long . the country will know the truth it will appreciate you messrs . the bolsheviki we shall see . . . as we came down the nevsky a little after midday the whole street before the duma building was crowded with people . here and there stood red guards and sailors with bayonetted rifles each one surrounded by about a hundred men and womenclerks students shopkeepers tchinovnikishaking their fists and bawling insults and menaces . on the steps stood boyscouts and officers distributing copies of the soldatski golos . a workman with a red band around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling with rage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the foot of the stairs demanding the surrender of the papers . . . . nothing like this i imagine ever occurred in history . on one side a handful of workmen and common soldiers with arms in their hands representing a victorious insurrectionand perfectly miserable on the other a frantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalks of fifth avenue at noontime sneering abusing shouting traitors provocators opritchniki savage bodyguards if ian the terrible 17th century the doors were guarded by students and officers with white armbands lettered in red militia of the committee of public safety and half a dozen boyscouts came and went . upstairs the place was all commotion . captain gomberg was coming down the stairs . theyre going to dissolve the duma he said . the bolshevik commissar is with the mayor now . as we reached the top riazanov came hurrying out . he had been to demand that the duma recognise the council of peoples commissars and the mayor had given him a flat refusal . in the offices a great babbling crowd hurrying shouting gesticulatinggovernment officials intellectuals journalists foreign correspondents french and british officers . . . . the city engineer pointed to them triumphantly . the embassies recognise the duma as the only power now he explained . for these bolshevik murderers and robbers it is only a question of hours . all russia is rallying to us . . . . in the alexander hall a monster meeting of the committee for salvation . fillipovsky in the chair and skobeliev again in the tribune reporting to immense applause new adhesions to the committee executive committee of peasants soviets old tsayeekah central army committee tsentroflot menshevik socialist revolutionary and front group delegates from the congress of soviets central committees of the menshevik socialist revolutionary populist socialist parties . yedinstvo group peasants union cooperatives zemstvos municipalities post and telegraph unions vikzhel council of the russian republic union of unions merchants and manufacturers association . . . . see notes and explanations . . . . . the power of the soviets is not democratic power but a dictatorshipand not the dictatorship of the proletariat but against the proletariat . all those who have felt or know how to feel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of the revolution . . . . the problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsible demagogues but to fight against the counterrevolution . . . . if rumours are true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting to profit by events in order to march on petrograd with other designs it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base of democratic government . otherwise troubles with the right will follow troubles from the left . . . . the garrison of petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizens buying the golos soldata and newsboys selling the rabotchaya gazeta are arrested in the streets . . . . the hour of resolutions has passed . . . . let those who have no longer faith in the revolution retire . . . . to establish a united power we must again restore the prestige of the revolution . . . . let us swear that either the revolution shall be savedor we shall perish the hall rose cheering with kindling eyes . there was not a single proletarian anywhere in sight . . . . then weinstein we must remain calm and not act until public opinion is firmly grouped in support of the committee for salvationthen we can pass from the defensive to action the vikzhel representative announced that his organisation was taking the initiative in forming the new government and its delegates were now discussing the matter with smolny . . . . followed a hot discussion were the bolsheviki to be admitted to the new government martov pleaded for their admission after all he said they represented an important political party . opinions were very much divided upon this the right wing mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries as well as the populist socialists the cooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against . . . . they have betrayed russia one speaker said . they have started civil war and opened the front to the germans . the bolsheviki must be mercilessly crushed . . . . skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the bolsheviki and the cadets . we got into conversation with a young socialist revolutionary who had walked out of the democratic conference to gether with the bolsheviki that night when tseretelli and the compromisers forced coalition upon the democracy of russia . you here i asked him . his eyes flashed fire . yes he cried . i left the congress with my party wednesday night . i have not risked my life for twenty years and more to submit now to the tyranny of the dark people . their methods are intolerable . but they have not counted on the peasants . . . . when the peasants begin to act then it is a question of minutes before they are done for . but the peasantswill they act doesnt the land decree settle the peasants what more do they want ah the land decree he said furiously . yes do you know what that land decree is it is our decreeit is the socialist revolutionary programme intact my party framed that policy after the most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasants themselves . it is an outrage . . . . but if it is your own policy why do you object if it is the peasants wishes why will they oppose it you dont understand dont you see that the peasants will immediately realise that it is all a trickthat these usurpers have stolen the socialist revolutionary programme i asked if it were true that kaledin was marching north . he nodded and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction . yes . now you see what these bolsheviki have done . they have raised the counterrevolution against us . the revolution is lost . the revolution is lost . but wont you defend the revolution of course we will defend itto the last drop of our blood . but we wont cooperate with the bolsheviki in any way . . . . but if kaledin comes to petrograd and the bolsheviki defend the city . wont you join with them of course not . we will defend the city also but we wont support the bolsheviki . kaledin is the enemy of the revolution but the bolsheviki are equally enemies of the revolution . which do you preferkaledin or the bolsheviki it is not a question to be discussed he burst out impatiently . i tell you the revolution is lost . and it is the bolsheviki who are to blame . but listenwhy should we talk of such things kerensky is comming . . . . day after tomorrow we shall pass to the offensive . . . . already smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a new government . but we have them nowthey are absolutely impotent . . . . we shall not cooperate . . . . outside there was a shot . we ran to the windows . a red guard finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd had shot into it wounding a young girl in the arm . we could see her being lifted into a cab surrounded by an excited throng the clamour of whose voices floated up to us . as we looked suddenly an armoured automobile appeared around the corner of the mikhailovsky its guns sluing this way and that . immediately the crowd began to run as petrograd crowds do falling down and lying still in the street piled in the gutters heaped up behind telephonepoles . the car lumbered up to the steps of the duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret demanding the surrender of the soldatski golos . the boyscouts jeered and scuttled into the building . after a moment the automobile wheeled undecidedly around and went off up the nevsky while some hundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dust their clothes . . . . inside was a prodigious runningabout of people with armfuls of soldatski golos looking for places to hide them . . . . a journalist came running into the room waving a paper . heres a proclamation from krasnov he cried . everybody crowded around . get it printedget it printed quick and around to the barracks by the order of the supreme commander i am appointed commandant of the troops concentrated under petrograd . citizens soldiers valorous cossacks of the don of the kuban of the transbaikal of the amur of the yenissei to all you who have remained faithful to your oath i appeal to you who have sworn to guard inviolable your oath of cossacki call upon you to save petrograd from anarchy from famine from tyranny and to save russia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men bought by the gold of wilhelm are trying to submit her . the provisional government to which you swore fidelity in the great days of march is not overthrown but by violence expelled from the edifice in which it held its meetings . however the government with the help of the front armies faithful to their duty with the help of the council of cossacks which has united under its command all the cossacks and which strong with the morale which reigns in its ranks and acting in accordance with the will of the russian people has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in the troublous times of 1612 when the cossacks of the don delivered moscow menaced by the swedes the poles and the lithuanians . your government still exists . . . . the active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt . their acts of vandalism and pillage their crimes the german mentality with which they regard russiastricken down but not yet surrenderedhave alienated from them the entire people . citizens soldiers valorous cossacks of the garrison of petrograd send me your delegates so that i may know who are traitors to their country and who are not that there may be avoided an effusion of innocent blood . almost the same moment word ran from group to group that the building was surrounded by red guards . an officer strode in a red band around his arm demanding the mayor . a few minutes later he left and old schreider came out of his office red and pale by turns . a special meeting of the duma he cried . immediately in the big hall proceedings were halted . all members of the duma for a special meeting whats the matter i dont knowgoing to arrest usgoing to dissolve the dumaarresting members at the door so ran the excited comments . in the nicolai hall there was barely room to stand . the mayor announced that troops were stationed at all the doors prohibiting all exit and entrance and that a commissar had threatened arrest and the dispersal of the municipal duma . a flood of impassioned speeches from members and even from the galleries responded . the freelyelected city government could not be dissolved by any power the mayors person and that of all the members were inviolable the tyrants the provocators the german agents should never be recognised as for these threats to dissolve us let them tryonly over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber where like the roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming of the goths . . . . resolution to inform the dumas and zemstvos of all russia by telegraph . resolution that it was impossible for the mayor or the chairman of the duma to enter into any relations whatever with representatives of the military revolutionary committee or with the socalled council of peoples commissars . resolution to address another appeal to the population of petrograd to stand up for the defence of their elected town government . resolution to remain in permanent session . . . . in the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he had telephoned to smolny and that the military revolutionary committee said that no orders had been given to surround the duma that the troops would be withdrawn . . . . as we went downstairs riazanov burst in through the front door very agitated . are you going to dissolve the duma i asked . my god no he answered . it is all a mistake . i told the mayor this morning that the duma would be left alone . . . . out on the nevsky in the deepening dusk a long double file of cyclists came riding guns slung on their shoulders . they halted and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions . who are you where do you come from asked a fat old man with a cigar in his mouth . twelfth army . from the front . we came to support the soviets against the damn bourgeoisie ah were furious cries . bolshevik gendarmes bolshevik cossacks a little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps . the garrison is turning he muttered in my ear . its the beginning of the end of the bolsheviki . do you want to see the turn of the tide come on he started at a halftrot up the mikhailovsky and we followed . what regiment is it the brunnoviki . . . . here was indeed serious trouble . the brunnoviki were the armoured car troops the key to the situation whoever controlled the brunnoviki controlled the city . the commissars of the committee for salvation and the duma have been talking to them . theres a meeting on to decide . . . . decide what which side theyll fight on oh no . thats not the way to do it . theyll never fight against the bolsheviki . they will vote to remain neutraland then the yunkers and cossacks the door of the great mikhailovsky ridingschool yawned blackly . two sentinels tried to stop us but we brushed by hurriedly deaf to their indignant expostulations . inside only a single arclight burned dimly high up near the roof of the enormous hall whose lofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom . around dimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars . one stood alone in the centre of the place under the light and round it were gathered some two thousand duncolored soldiers almost lost in the immensity of that imperial building . a dozen men officers chairmen of the soldiers committees and speakers were perched on top of the car and from the central turret a soldier was speaking . this was khanjunov who had been president of last summers allrussian congress of brunnoviki . a lithe handsome figure in his leather coat with lieutenants shoulderstraps he stood pleading eloquently for neutrality . it is an awful thing he said for russians to kill their russian brothers . there must not be civil war between soldiers who stood shoulder to shoulder against the tsar and conquered the foreign enemy in battles which will go down in history what have we soldiers got to do with these squabbles of political parties i will not say to you that the provisional government was a democratic government we want no coalition with the bourgeoisieno . but we must have a government of the united democracy or russia is lost with such a government there will be no need for civil war and the killing of brother by brother this sounded reasonablethe great hall echoed to the crash of hands and voices . a soldier climbed up his face white and strained comrades he cried i came from the rumanian front to urgently tell you all there must be peace peace at once whoever can give us peace whether it be the bolsheviki or this new government we will follow . peace we at the front cannot fight any longer . we cannot fight either germans or russians with that he leaped down and a sort of confused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass which burst into something like anger when the next speaker a menshevik oboronetz tried to say that the war must go on until the allies were victorious . you talk like kerensky shouted a rough voice . a duma delegate pleading for neutrality . him they listened to muttering uneasily feeling him not one of them . never have i seen men trying so hard to understand to decide . they never moved stood staring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker their brows wrinkled with the effort of thought sweat standing out on their foreheads great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes of children and the faces of epic warriors . . . . now a bolshevik was speaking one of their own men violently full of hate . they liked him no more than the other . it was not their mood . for the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run of common thoughts thinking in terms of russia of socialism the world as if it depended on them whether the revolution were to live or die . . . . speaker succeeded speaker debating amid tense silence roars of approval or anger should we come out or not khanjunov returned persuasive and sympathetic . but wasnt he an officer and an oboronotz however much he talked of peace then a workman from vasili ostrov but him they greeted with and are you going to give us peace workingman near us some men many of them officers formed a sort of claque to cheer the advocates of neutrality . they kept shouting khanjunov khanjunov and whistled insultingly when the bolsheviki tried to speak . suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobile began to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation . the audience shouted to know what was the matter and all the great mass tossed and stirred . a soldier held back by one of the officers wrenched himself loose and held up his hand . comrades he cried comrade krylenko is here and wants to speak to us . an outburst of cheers whistlings yells of prosim prosim dolby go ahead go ahead down with him in the midst of which the peoples commissar for military affairs clambered up the side of the car helped by hands before and behind pushed and pulled from below and above . rising he stood for a moment and then walked out on the radiator put his hands on his hips and looked around smiling a squat shortlegged figure bareheaded without insignia on his uniform . the claque near me kept up a fearful shouting khanjunov we want khanjunov down with him shut up down with the traitor the whole place seethed and roared . then it began to move like an avalanche bearing down upon us great blackbrowed men forcing their way through . who is breaking up our meeting they shouted . who is whistling here the claque rudely burst asunder went flyingnor did it gather again . . . . comrade soliders began krylenko in a voice husky with fatigue . i cannot speak well to you i am sorry but i have not had any sleep for four nights . . . . i dont need to tell you that i am a soldier . i dont need to tell you that i want peace . what i must say is that the bolshevik party successful in the workers and soldiers revolution by the help of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever the power of the bloodthirsty bourgeoisie promised to offer peace to all the peoples and that has already been donetoday tumultuous applause . you are asked to remain neutralto remain neutral while the yunkers and the death battalions who are never neutral shoot us down in the streets and bring back to petrograd kerenskyor perhaps some other of the gang . kaledin is marching from the don . kerensky is coming from the front . kornilov is raising the tekhintsi to repeat his attempt of august . all these mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civil warhow have they retained the power except by civil war that civil war which has endured ever since last july and in which they constantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie as they do now how can i persuade you if you have made up your minds the question is very plain . on one side are kerensky kaledin kornilov the mensheviki socialist revolutionaries cadets dumas officers . . . . they tell us that their objects are good . on the other side are the workers the soldiers and sailors the poorest peasants . the government is in your hands . you are the masters . great russia belongs to you . will you give it back while he spoke he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words broke through the tired voice . at the end he totered almost falling a hundred hands reached up to help him down and the great dim spaces of the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him . khanjunov tried to speak again but vote vote vote they cried . at length giving in he read the resolution that the brunnoviki withdraw their representative from the military revolutionary committee and declare their neutrality in the present civil war . all those in favour should go to the right those opposed to the left . there was a moment of hesitation a still expectancy and then the crowd began to surge faster and faster stumbling over one another to the left hundreds of big soldiers in a solid mass rushing across the dirt floor in the faint light . . . . near us about fifty men were left stranded stubbornly in favour and even as the high roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring they turned and rapidly walked out of the buildingand some of them out of the revolution . . . . imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city the district the whole front all russia . imagine the sleepless krylenkos watching the regiments hurrying from place to place arguing threatening entreating . and then imaging the same in all the locals of every labour union in the factories the villages on the battleships of the farflung russian fleets think of the hundreds of thousands of russian men staring up at speakers all over the vast country workmen peasants soldiers sailors trying so hard to understand and to choose thinking so intenselyand deciding so unanimously at the end . so was the russian revolution . . . . up at smolny the new council of peoples commissars was not idle . already the first decree was on the presses to be circulated in thousands through the city streets that night and shipped in bales by every train southward and east in the name of the government of the russian republic chosen by the allrussian congress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputies with participation of peasant deputies the council of peoples commissars decrees 1 . the elections for the constituent assembly shall take place at the date determined uponnovember 12 . 2 . all electoral commissions organs of local selfgovernment soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies and soldiers organisations on the front should make every effort to assure free and regular elections at the date determined upon . in the name of the government of the russian republic the president of the council of peoples commissars vladimir ulianovlenin . in the municipal building the duma was in full blast . a member of the council of the republic was talking as we came in . the council he said did not consider itself dissolved at all but merely unable to continue its labours until it secured a new meetingplace . in the meanwhile its committee of elders had determined to enter en masse the committee for salvation . . . . this i may remark parenthetically is the last time history mentions the council of the russian republic . . . . then followed the customary string of delegates from the ministries the vikzhel the union of posts and telegraphs for the hundredth time reiterating their determination not to work for the bolshevik usurpers . a yunker who had been in the winter palace told a highlycoloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades and disgraceful conduct of the red guardsall of which was devoutly believed . somebody read aloud an account in the socialist revolutionary paper narod which stated that five hundred million rubles worth of damage had been done in the winter palace and describing in great detail the loot and breakage . from time to time couriers came from the telephone with news . the four socialist ministers had been released from prison . krylenko had gone to peterpaul to tell admiral verderevsky that the ministry of marine was deserted and to beg him for the sake of russia to take charge under the authority of the council of peoples commissars and the old seaman had consented . . . . kerensky was advancing north from gatchina the bolshevik garrisons falling back before him . smolny had issued another decree enlarging the powers of the city dumas to deal with food supplies . this last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury . he lenin the usurper the tyrant whose commissars had seized the municipal garage entered the municipal ware houses were interfering with the supply committees and the distribution of foodhe presumed to define the limits of power of the free independent autonomous city government one member shaking his fist moved to cut off the food of the city if the bolsheviki dared to interfere with the supply committees . . . . another representative of the special supply committee reported that the food situation was very grave and asked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains . diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering . the semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the orders of the socialist revolutionary party the crews of the torpedoboats on the neva were shaky . seven members were at once appointed to continue the propaganda . . . . then the old mayor stepped into the tribune comrades and citizens i have just learned that the prisoners in peter paul are in danger . fourteen yunkers of the pavlovsk school have been stripped and tortured by the bolshevik guards . one has gone mad . they are threatening to lynch the ministers there was a whirlwind of indignation and horror which only grew more violent when a stocky little woman dressed in grey demanded the floor and lifted up her hard metallic voice . this was vera slutskaya veteran revolutionist and bolshevik member of the duma . that is a lie and a provocation she said unmoved at the torrent of abuse . the workers and peasants government which has abolished the death penalty cannot permit such deeds . we demand that this story be investigated at once if there is any truth in it the government will take energetic measures a commission composed of members of all parties was immediately appointed and with the mayor sent to peter paul to investigate . as we followed them out the duma was appointing another commission to meet kerenskyto try and avoid bloodshed when he entered the capital . . . . it was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate of the fortress and went forward under the faint glimmer of rare electric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs of the tsars beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes which for months continued to play bozhe tsaria khrani every day at god save the tsar . noon . . . . the place was deserted in most of the windows there were not even lights . occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumbling along in the dark who answered questions with the usual ya nieznayu . graphic page166 pass to reed fromdepartment of prisons translation follows pass from the department of prisons of the soviet government to visit

american socialist press john reed to visit all places of confinement in the cities of petrograd and cronstadt for the purpose of generally investigating the condition of the prisoners and for thorough social information for the purpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy . chief commissar secretary on the left loomed the low dark outline of trubetskoi bastion that living grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost their lives or their reason in the days of the tsar where the provisional government had in turn shut up the ministers of the tsar and now the bolsheviki had shut up the ministers of the provisional government . a friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant in a little house near the mint . half a dozen red guards sailors and soldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke in which a samovar steamed cheerfully . they welcomed us with great cordiality offering tea . the commandant was not in he was escorting a commission of sabotazhniki sabotageurs from the city duma who insisted that the yunkers were all being murdered . this seemed to amuse them very much . at one side of the room sat a baldheaded dissipatedlooking little man in a frockcoat and a rich fur coat biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat . he had just been arrested . somebody said glancing carelessly at him that he was a minister or something . . . . the little man didnt seem to hear it he was evidently terrified although the occupants of the room showed no animosity whatever toward him . i went across and spoke to him in french . count tolstoy he answered bowing stiffly . i do not understand why i was arrested . i was crossing the troitsky bridge on my way home when two of theseof thesepersons held me up . i was a commissar of the provisional government attached to the general staff but in no sense a member of the government . . . let him gosaid a sailor . hes harmless . . . . no responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner . we must ask the commandant . oh the commandant sneered the sailor . what did you make a revolution for to go on obeying officers a praporshtchik of the pavlovsky regiment was telling us how the insurrection started . the polk regiment was on duty at the general staff the night of the 6th . some of my comrades and i were standing guard ivan pavlovitch and another mani dont remember his namewell they hid behind the windowcurtains in the room where the staff was having a meeting and they heard a great many things . for any things . for example they heard orders to bring the gatchina yunkers to petrograd by night and an order for the cossacks to be ready to march in the morning . . . . the principal points in the city were to be occupied before dawn . then there was the business of opening the bridges . but when they began to talk about surrounding smolny then ivan pavlovitch couldnt stand it any longer . that minute there was a good deal of coming and going so he slipped out and came down to the guardroomleaving the other comrade to pick up what he could . i was already suspicious that something was going on . automobiles full of officers kept coming and all the ministers were there . ivan pavlovitch told me what he had heard . it was halfpast two in the morning . the secretary of the regimental committee was there so we told him and asked what to do . arrest everybody coming and going he says . so we began to do it . in an hour we had some officers and a couple of ministers whom we sent up to smolny right away . but the military revolutionary committee wasnt ready they didnt know what to do and pretty soon back came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else . well we ran all the way to smolny and i guess we talked for an hour before they finally saw that it was war . it was five oclock when we got back to the staff and by that time most of them were gone . but we got a few and the garrison was all on the march . . . . a red guard from vasili ostrov described in great detail what had happened in his district on the great day of the rising . we didnt have any machineguns over there he said laughing and we couldnt get any from smolny . comrade zalking who was a member of the uprava central bureau of the ward duma remembered all at once that there was lying in the meetingroom of the uprava a machinegun which had been captured from the germans . so he and i and another comrade went there . the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries were having a meeting . well we opened the door and walked right in on them as they sat around the tabletwelve or fifteen of them three of us . when they saw us they stopped talking and just stared . we walked right across the room uncoupled the machinegun comrade zalkind picked up one part i the other we put them on our shoulders and walked outand not a single man said a word do you know how the winter palace was captured asked a third man a sailor . along about eleven oclock we found out there werent any more yunkers on the neva side . so we broke in the doors and filtered up the different stairways one by one or in little bunches . when we got to the top of the stairs the yunkers held us up and took away our guns . still our fellows kept coming up little by little until we had a majority . then we turned around and took away the yunkers guns . . . . just then the commandant entereda merrylooking young noncommissioned officer with his arm in a sling and deep circles of sleeplessness under his eyes . his eye fell first on the prisoner who at once began to explain . oh yes interrupted the other . you were one of the committee who refused to surrender the staff wednesday afternoon . however we dont want you citizen . apologies he opened the door and waved his arm for count tolstoy to leave . several of the others especially the red guards grumbled protests and the sailor remarked triumphantly vot there didnt i say so two soldiers now engaged his attention . they had been elected a committee of the fortress garrison to protest . the prisoners they said were getting the same food as the guards when there wasnt even enough to keep a man from being hungry . why should the counterrevolutionists be treated so well we are revolutionists comrades not bandits answered the commandant . he turned to us . we explained that rumours were going about that the yunkers were being tortured and the lives of the ministers threatened . could we perhaps see the prisoners so as to be able to prove to the world no said the young soldier irritably . i am not going to disturb the prisoners again . i have just been compelled to wake them upthey were sure we were going to massacre them . . . . most of the yunkers have been released anyway and the rest will go out tomorrow . he turned abruptly away . could we talk to the duma commission then the commandant who was pouring himself a glass of tea nodded . they are still out in the hall he said carelessly . indeed they stood there just outside the door in the feeble light of an oil lamp grouped around the mayor and talking excitedly . mr . mayor i said we are american correspondents . will you please tell us officially the result of your investigations he turned to us his face of venerable dignity . there is no truth in the reports he said slowly . except for the incidents which occurred as the ministers were being brought here they have been treated with every consideration . as for the yunkers not one has received the slightest injury . . . . up the nevsky in the empty aftermidnight gloom an interminable column of soldiers shuffled in silenceto battle with kerensky . in dim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro and there was furtive activity in fontanka 6 headquarters of the peasants soviet in a certain apartment of a huge building on the nevsky and in the injinierny zamok school of engineers the duma was illuminated . . . . in smolny institute the military revolutionary committee flashed baleful fire pounding like an overloaded dynamo . . . . chapter vii the revolutionary front saturday november 10th

severely punished . . . . following the example of the paris commune the committee will destroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder . . . . quiet lay the city . not a holdup not a robbery not even a drunken fight . by night armed patrols went through the silent streets and on the corners soldiers and red guards squatted around little fires laughing and singing . in the daytime great crowds gathered on the sidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students and soldiers business men and workmen . citizens stopped each other on the street . the cossacks are coming no . . . . whats the latest i dont know anything . wheres kerensky they say only eight versts from petrograd . . . . is it true that the bolsheviki have fled to the battleship avrora they say so . . . . only the walls screamed and the few newspapers denunciation appeal decree . . . . an enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the executive committee of the peasant soviets . . . .they the bolsheviki dare to say that they are supported by the soviets of peasants deputies and that they are speaking on behalf of the soviets of peasants deputies . . . . let all workingclass russia know that this is a lie and that all the working peasantsin the person ofthe executive committee of the allrussian soviets of peasants deputiesrefutes with indignation all participation of the organised peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the workingclasses . . . . from the soldier section of the socialist revolutionary party the insane attempt of the bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse . the garrison is divided . . . . the ministries are on strike and bread is getting scarcer . all factions except the few bolsheviki have left the congress . the bolsheviki are alone . . . . we call upon all sane elements to group themselves around the committee for salvation of country and revolution and to prepare themselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the central committee . . . . in a handbill the council of the republic recited its wrongs ceding to the force of bayonets the council of the republic has been obliged to separate and temporarily to interrupt its meetings . the usurpers with the words liberty and socialism on their lips have set up a rule of arbitrary violence . they have arrested the members of the provisional government closed the newspapers seized the printingshops . . . .this power must be considered the enemy of the people and the revolution it is necessary to do battle with it and to pull it down . . . . the council of the republic until the resumption of its labours invites the citizens of the russian republic to group themselves around the . . . .local committees for salvation of country and revolution which are organising the overthrow of the bolsheviki and the creation of a government capable of leading the country to the constituent assembly . dielo narodasaid a revolution is a rising of all the people . . . . but here

slovopeopleswordpopulistsocialist workers and peasants government that is only a pipedream nobody either in russia or in the countries of our allies will recognise this governmentor even in the enemy countries . . . . the bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared . . . .pravada had an account of the first meeting of the new tsayeekah now the parliament of the russian soviet republic . miliutin commissar of agriculture remarked that the peasants executive committee had called an allrussian peasant congress for december 13th . but we cannot wait he said . we must have the backing of the peasants . i propose that we call the congress of peasants and do it immediately . . . . the left socialist revolutionaries agreed . an appeal to the peasants of russia was hastily drafted and a committee of five elected to carry out the project . the question of detailed plans for distributing the land and the question of workers control of industry were postponed until the experts working on them should submit a report . three decrees see app . vii sect . 1 were read and approved first lenins general rules for the press ordering the suppression of all newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the new government inciting to criminal acts or deliberately perverting the news the decree of moratorium for houserents and the decree establishing a workers militia . also orders one giving the municipal duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses the other directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroad terminals to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free the badlyneeded rollingstock . . . . two hours later the executive committee of the peasants soviets was sending broadcast over russia the following telegram the arbitrary organisation of the bolsheviki which is called bureau of organisation for the national congress of peasantsis inviting all the peasants soviets to send delegates to the congress at petrograd . . . . the executive committee of the soviets of peasants deputies declares that it considers now as well as before that it would be dangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forces necessary to prepare for elections to the constituent assembly which is the only salvation of the workingclass and the country . we confirm the date of the congress of peasants december 13th . at the duma all was excitement officers coming and going the mayor in conference with the leaders of the committee for salvation . a councillor ran in with a copy of kerenskys proclamation dropped by hundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the nevsky which threatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit and ordered soldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in mars field . the ministerpresident had taken tsarskoye selo we were told and was already in the petrograd campagna five miles away . he would enter the city tomorrowin a few hours . the soviet troops in contact with his cossacks were said to be going over to the provisional government . tchernov was somewhere in between trying to organise the neutral troops into a force to halt the civil war . in the city the garrison regiments were leaving the bolsheviki they said . smolny was already abandoned . . . . all the governmental machinery had stopped functioning . the employees of the state bank had refused to work under commissars from smolny refused to pay out money to them . all the private banks were closed . the ministries were on strike . even now a committee from the duma was making the rounds of business houses collecting a fund to pay the salaries of the strikers . . . . trotzky had gone to the ministry of foreign affairs and ordered the clerks to translate the decree on peace into foreign languages six hundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face . . . . shliapnikov commissar of labour had commanded all the employees of his ministry to return to their places within twentyfour hours or lose their places and their pensionrights only the doorservants had responded . . . . some of the branches of the special food supply committee had suspended work rather than submit to the bolsheviki . . . . in spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions the operators at the telephone exchange would not connect soviet headquarters . . . . the socialist revolutionary party had voted to expel all members who had remained in the congress of soviets and all who were taking part in the insurrection . . . . news from the provinces . moghilev had declared against the bolsheviki . at kiev the cossacks had overthrown the soviets and arrested all the insurrectionary leaders . the soviet and garrison of luga thirty thousand strong affirmed its loyalty to the provisional government and appealed to all russia to rally around it . kaledin had dispersed all soviets and unions in the don basin and his forces were moving north . . . . said a representative of the railway workers yesterday we sent a telegram all over russia demanding that war between the political parties cease at once and insisting on the formation of a coalition socialist government . otherwise we shall call a strike tomorrow night . . . . in the morning there will be a meeting of all factions to consider the question . the bolsheviki seem anxious for an agreement . . . . if they last that long laughed the city engineer a stout ruddy man . . . . as we came up to smolnynot abandoned but busier than ever throngs of workers and soldiers running in and out and doubled guards everywherewe met the reporters for the bourgeois and moderate socialist papers . threw us out cried one from volia naroda . bonchbruevitch came down to the press bureau and told us to leave said we were spies they all began to talk at once insult outrage freedom of the press in the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals proclamations and orders of the military revolutionary committee . workmen and soldiers staggered past carrying them to waiting automobiles . one began to the pillory in this tragic moment through which the russian masses are living the mensheviki and their followers and the right socialist revolutionaries have betrayed the workingclass . they have enlisted on the side of kornilov kerensky and savinkov . . . . they are printing orders of the traitor kerensky and creating a panic in the city spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythical victories by that renegade . . . . citizens dont believe these false rumours . no power can defeat the peoples revolution . . . . premier kerensky and his followers await speedy and welldeserved punishment . . . . we are putting them in the pillory . we are abandoning them to the enmity of all workers soldiers sailors and peasants on whom they are trying to rivet the ancient chains . they will never be able to wash from their bodies the stain of the peoples hatred and contempt . shame and curses to the traitors of the people . . . the military revolutionary committee had moved into larger quarters room 17 on the top floor . red guards were at the door . inside the narrow space in front of the railing was crowded with welldressed persons outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murderbourgeois who wanted permits for their automobiles or passports to leave the city among them many foreigners . . . . bill shatov and peters were on duty . they suspended all other business to read us the latest bulletins . the one hundred seventyninth reserve regiment offers its unanimous support . five thousand stevedores at the putilov wharves greet the new government . central committee of the trade unionsenthusiastic support . the garrison and squadron at reval elect military revolutionary

points of the city two companies on duty in the kremlin have gone over to the soviets but the arsenal is in the hands of colonel diabtsev and his yunkers . the revolutionary committee demanded arms for the workers and riabtsev parleyed with them until this morning when suddenly he sent an ultimatum to the committee ordering soviet troops to surrender and the committee to disband . fighting has begun . . . . in petrograd the staff submitted to smolnys commissars at once . the tsentroflot refusing was stormed by dybenko and a company of cronstadt sailors and a new tsentroflot set up supported by the baltic and the black sea battleships . . . . but beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition a feeling of uneasiness in the air . kerenskys cossacks were coming fast they had artillery . skripnik secretary of the factoryshop committees his face drawn and yellow assured me that there was a whole army corps of them but he added fiercely theyll never take us alive petrovsky laughed weariedly tomorrow maybe well get a sleepa long one . . . . lozovsky with his emaciated redbearded face said what chance have we all alone . . . . a mob against trained soldiers south and southwest the soviets had fled before kerensky and the garrisons of gatchina pavlovsk tsarskoye selo were dividedhalf voting to remain neutral the rest without officers falling back on the capital in the wildest disorder . in the halls they were pasting up bulletins from krasnoye selo november 10th 8 a .m . to be communicated to all commanders of staffs commanders in chief commanders everywhere and to all all all . the exminister kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram to every one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionary petrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined the armies of the former government the government of treason and that the soldiers have been ordered by the military revolutionary committee to retreat . the troops of a free people do not retreat nor do they surrender . our troops have left gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed between themselves and their mistaken brothercossacks and in order to take a more convenient position which is at present so strong that if kerensky and his companions in arms should even increase their forces ten times still there would be no cause for anxiety . the spirit of our troops is excellent . in petrograd all is quiet . chief of the defence of petrograd and the petrograd district lieutenantcolonel muraviov . as we left the military revolutionary committee antonov entered a paper in his hand looking like a corpse . send this said he . to all district soviets of workers deputies and factoryshop committees the kornilovist bands of kerensky are threatening the approaches to the capital . all the necessary orders have been given to crush mercilessly the counterrevolutionary attempt against the people and its conquests . the army and the red guard of the revolution are in need of the immediate support of the workers . we order the ward soviets and factoryshop committees 1 . to move out the greatest possible number of workers for the digging of trenches the erection of barricades and reinforcing of wire entanglements . 2 . wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work at the factories this shall be done immediately . 3 . all common and barbed wire available must be assembled and also all implements for the digging of trenches and the erection of barricades . 4 . all available arms must be taken . 5 . the strictest discipline is to be observed and every one must be ready to support the army of the revolution by all means . chairman of the petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies peoples commissar leon trotzky . chairman of the military revolutionary committee commander in chief podvoisky . as we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the grey horizon factory whistles were blowing a hoarse and nervous sound full of foreboding . by tens of thousands the workingpeople poured out men and women by tens of thousands the humming slums belched out their dun and miserable hordes . red petrograd was in danger cossacks south and southwest they poured through the shabby streets toward the moskovsky gate men women and children with rifles picks spades rolls of wire cartridgebelts over their working clothes . . . . such an immense spontaneous outpouring of a city never was seen they rolled along torrentlike companies of soldiers borne with them guns motortrucks wagonsthe revolutionary proletariat defending with its breast the capital of the workers and peasants republic before the door of smolny was an automobile . a slight man with thick glasses magnifying his redrimmed eyes his speech a painful effort stood leaning against a mudguard with his hands in the pockets of a shabby raglan . a great bearded sailor with the clear eyes of youth prowled restlessly about absently toying with an enormous bluesteel revolver which never left his hand . these were antonov and dybenko . some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on the runningboard . the chauffeur violently protested the enamel would get scratched he said . true he was a bolshevik and the automobile was commandeered from a bourgeois true the bicycles were for the use of orderlies . but the chauffeurs professional pride was revolted . . . . so the bicycles were abandoned . . . . the peoples commissars for war and marine were going to inspect the revolutionary frontwherever that was . could we go with them certainly not . the automobile only held fivethe two commissars two orderlies and the chauffeur . however a russian acquaintance of mine whom i will call trusishka calmly got in and sat down nor could any argument dislodge him . . . . i see no reason to doubt trusishkas story of the journey . as they went down the suvorovsky prospect some one mentioned food . they might be out three or four days in a country indifferently well provisioned . they stopped the car . money the commissar of war looked through his pocketshe hadnt a kopek . the commissar of marine was broke . so was the chauffeur . trusishka bought the provisions . . . . just as they turned into the nevsky a tire blew out . what shall we do asked antonov . commandeer another machine suggested dybenko waving his revolver . antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled a passing machine driven by a soldier . i want that machine said antonov . you wont get it responded the soldier . do you know who i am antonov produced a paper upon which was written that he had been appointed commanderinchief of all the armies of the russian republic and that every one should obey him without question . i dont care if youre the devil himself said the soldier hotly . this machine belongs to the first machinegun regiment and were carrying ammunition in it and you cant have it . . . . the difficulty however was solved by the appearance of an old battered taxicab flying the italian flag . in time of trouble private cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates so as to be safe from requisition . from the interior of this was dislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat and the party continued on its way . arrived at narvskaya zastava about ten miles out antonov called for the commandant of the red guard . he was led to the edge of the town where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and were waiting for the cossacks . everything all right here comrade asked antonov . everything perfect comrade answered the commandant . the troops are in excellent spirits . . . . only one thingwe have no ammunition . . . . in smolny there are two billion rounds antonov told him . i will give you an order . he felt in his pockets . has any one a piece of paper dybenko had nonenor the couriers . trusishka had to offer his notebook . . . . devil i have no pencil cried antonov . whos got a pencil needless to say trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd . . . . we who were left behind made for the tsarskoye selo station . up the nevsky as we passed red guards were marching all armed some with bayonets and some without . the early twilight of winter was falling . heads up they tramped in the chill mud irregular lines of four without music without drums . a red flag crudely lettered in gold peace land floated over them . they were very young . the expression on their faces was that of who know they are going to die . . . . halffearful halfcontemptuous the crowds on the sidewalk watched them pass in hateful silence . . . . graphic page184 pass to the northern front this pass was issued upon the recommendation of trotzky three days after the bolshevik revolution . it gives me the right of free travel to the northern frontand an added note on the back extends the permission to all fronts . it will be noticed that the speaks of the petersburg instead of the petrograd soviet it was the fashion among thoroughgoing internationalists to abolish all names which smacked of patriotism but at the same time it would not do to restore the saint . . . . translation executive committee petrograd soviet of workers and soldiers deputies military section 28th october 1917 no . 1435 certificate the present certificate is given to the representative of the american social democracy the internationalist comrade john reed . the military revolutionary committee of the petersburg soviet of workers and soldiers deputies gives him the right of free travel through the entire northern front for the purpose of reporting to our american comradesinternationalists concerning events in russia . for the president for the secretary at the railroad station nobody knew just where kerensky was or where the front lay . trains went no further however than tsarskoye . . . . our car was full of commuters and country people going home laden with bundles and evening papers . the talk was all of the bolshevik rising . outside of that however one would never have realised that civil war was rending mighty russia in two and that the train was headed into the zone of battle . through the window we could see in the swiftlydeepening darkness masses of soldiers going along the muddy road toward the city flinging out their arms in argument . a freighttrain swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires was halted on a siding . that was all . back along the flat horizon the glow of the citys lights faded down the night . a streetcar crawled distantly along a farflung suburb . . . . tsarskoye selostation was quiet but knots of soldiers stood here and there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the empty track in the direction of gatchina . i asked some of them which side they were on . well said one we dont exactly know the rights of the matter . . . . there is no doubt that kerensky is a provocator but we do not consider it right for russian men to be shooting russian men . in the station commandants office was a big jovial bearded common soldier wearing the red armband of a regimental committee . our credentials from smolny commanded immediate respect . he was plainly for the soviets but bewildered . the red guards were here two hours ago but they went away again . a commissar came this morning but he returned to petrograd when the cossacks arrived . the cossacks are here then he nodded gloomily . there has been a battle . the cossacks came early in the morning . they captured two or three hundred of our men and killed about twentyfive . where are the cossacks well they didnt get this far . i dont know just where they are . off that way . . . . he waved his arm vaguely westward . we had dinneran excellent dinner better and cheaper than could be got in petrogradin the station restaurant . nearby sat a french officer who had just come on foot from gatchina . all was quiet there he said . kerensky held the town . ah these russians he went on they are original what a civil war everything except the fighting we sallied out into the town . just at the door of the station stood two soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed . they were surrounded by about a hundred business men government officials and students who attacked them with passionate argument and epithet . the soldiers were uncomfortable and hurt like children unjustly scolded . a tall young man with a supercilious expression dressed in the uniform of a student was leading the attack . you realise i presume he said insolently that by taking up arms against your brothers you are making yourselves the tools of murderers and traitors now brotheranswered the soldier earnestly you dont understand . there are two classes dont you see the proletariat and the bourgeoisie . we oh i know that silly talk broke in the student rudely . a bunch of ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a few catchwords . you dont understand what they mean . you just echo them like a lot of parrots . the crowd laughed . im a marxian student . and i tell you that this isnt socialism you are fighting for . its just plain progerman anarchy oh yes i know answered the soldier with sweat dripping from his brow . you are an educated man that is easy to see and i am only a simple man . but it seems to me i suppose interrupted the other contemptuously that you believe lenin is a real friend of the proletariat yes i do answered the soldier suffering . well my friend do you know that lenin was sent through germany in a closed car do you know that lenin took money from the germans well i dont know much about that answered the soldier stubbornly but it seems to me that what he says is what i want to hear and all the simple men like me . now there are two classes the bourgeoisie and the proletariat you are a fool why my friend i spent two years in schlsselburg for revolutionary activity when you were still shooting down revolutionists and singing god save the tsar my name is vasili georgevitch panyin . didnt you ever hear of me im sorry to say i never did answered the soldier with humility . but then i am not an educated man . you are probably a great hero . i am said the student with conviction . and i am opposed to the bolsheviki who are destroying our russia our free revolution . now how do you account for that the soldier scratched his head . i cant account for it at all he said grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes . to me it seems perfectly simplebut then im not well educated . it seems like there are only two classes the proletariat and the bourgeoisie there you go again with your silly formula cried the student . only two classes went on the soldier doggedly . ldquoand whoever isnt on one side is on the other . . . we wandered on up the street where the lights were few and far between and where people rarely passed . a threatening silence hung over the placeas of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell a political no mans land . only the barber shops were all brilliantly lighted and crowded and a line formed at the doors of the public bath for it was saturday night when all russia bathes and perfumes itself . i havent the slightest doubt that soviet troops and cossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed . the nearer we came to the imperial park the more deserted were the streets . a frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of the soviet and hurried on . it was in the wing of one of the grand ducal palaces fronting the park . the windows were dark the door locked . a soldier lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion . the soviet went away two days ago said he . where a shrug . nie znayu . i dont know . a little further along was a large building brightly illuminated . from within came a sound of hammering . while we were hesitating a soldier and a sailor came down the street hand in hand . i showed them my pass from smolny . are you for the soviets i asked . they did not answer but looked at each other in a frightened way . what is going on in there asked the sailor pointing to the building . i dont know . timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack . inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens rows of chairs a stage being built . a stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tacks came out . what do you want she asked . is there a performance tonight said the sailor nervously . there will be private theatricals sunday night she answered severely . go away . we tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation but they seemed frightened and unhappy and drew off into the darkness . we strolled toward the imperial palaces along the edge of the vast dark gardens their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridges looming uncertainly in the night and soft water splashing from the fountains . at one place where a ridiculous iron swan spat unceasingly from an artificial grotto we were suddenly aware of observation and looked up to encounter the sullen suspicious gaze of half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers who stared moodily down from a grassy terrace . i climbed up to them . who are you i asked . we are the guard answered one . they all looked very depressed as undoubtedly they were from weeks and weeks of allday allnight argument and debate . are you kerenskys troops or the soviets there was silence for a moment as they looked uneasily at each other . then we are neutral said he . we went on through the arch of the huge ekaterina palace into the palace enclosure itself asking for headquarters . a sentry outside a door in a curving white wing of the palace said that the commandant was inside . in a graceful white georgian room divided into unequal parts by a twosided fireplace a group of officers stood anxiously talking . they were pale and distracted and evidently hadnt slept . to one an oldish man with a white beard his uniform studded with decorations who was pointed out as the colonel we showed our bolshevik papers . he seemed surprised . how did you get here without being killed he asked politely . it is very dangerous in the streets just now . political passion is running very high in tsarskoye selo . there was a battle this morning and there will be another tomorrow morning . kerensky is to enter the town at eight oclock . where are the cossacks about a mile over that way . he waved his arm . and you will defend the city against them oh dear no . he smiled . we are holding the city for kerensky . our hearts sank for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to the core . the colonel cleared his throat . about those passes of yours he went on . your lives will be in danger if you are captured . therefore if you want to see the battle i will give you an order for rooms in the officers hotel and if you will come back here at seven oclock in the morning i will give you new passes . so you are for kerensky we said . well not exactly for kerensky . the colonel hesitated . you see most of the soldiers in the garrison are bolsheviki and today after the battle they all went away in the direction of petrograd taking the artillery with them . you might say that none of the soldiers are for kerensky but some of them just dont want to fight at all . the officers have almost all gone over to kerenskys forces or simply gone away . we areahemin a most difficult position as you see . . . . we did not believe that there would be any battle . . . . the colonel courteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station . he was from the south born of french immigrant parents in bessarabia . ah he kept saying it is not the danger or the hardships i mind but being so long three years away from my mother . . . . looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the cold dark toward petrograd i caught glimpses of clumps of soldiers gesticulating in the light of fires and of clusters of armoured cars halted together at crossroads the chauffeurs hanging out of the turrets and shouting to each other . . . . all the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands of soldiers and red guards wandered clashing and confused and the commissars of the military revolutionary committee hurried from one group to another trying to organise a defence . . . . back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down the nevsky . something was in the air . from the warsaw railway station could be heard faroff cannonade . in the yunker schools there was feverish activity . duma members went from barracks to barracks arguing and pleading narrating fearful stories of bolshevik violencemassacre of the yunkers in the winter palace rape of the women soldiers the shooting of the girl before the duma the murder of prince tumanov . . . . in the alexander hall of the duma building the committee for salvation was in special session commissars came and went running . . . . all the journalists expelled from smolny were there in high spirits . they did not believe our report of conditions in tsarskoye . why everybody knew that tsarskoye was in kerenskys hands and that the cossacks were now at pulkovo . a committee was being elected to meet kerensky at the railway station in the morning . . . . one confided to me in strictest secrecy that the counterrevolution would begin at midnight . he showed me two proclamations one signed by gotz and polkovnikov ordering the yunker schools soldier convalescents in the hospitals and the knights of st . george to mobilise on a war footing and wait for orders from the committee for salvation the other from the committee for salvation itself which read as follows to the population of petrograd comrades workers soldiers and citizens of revolutionary petrograd nary petrograd the bolsheviki while appealing for peace at the front are inciting to civil war in the rear . do not dig their provocatory appeals do not dig trenches down with the traitorous barricades lay down your arms soldiers return to your barracks the war begun in petrogradis the death of the revolution in the name of liberty land and peace unite around the committee for salvation of country and revolution as we left the duma a company of red guards sternfaced and desperate came marching down the dark deserted street with a dozen prisonersmembers of the local branch of the council of cossacks caught redhanded plotting counterrevolution in their headquarters . . . . a soldier accompanied by a small boy with a pail of paste was sticking up great flaring notices by virtue of the present the city of petrograd and its suburbs are declared in a state of siege . all assemblies or meetings in the streets and generally in the open air are forbidden until further orders . n . podvoisky president of the military revolutionary committee . as we went home the air was full of confused soundautomobile horns shouts distant shots . the city stirred uneasily wakeful . in the small hours of the morning a company of yunkers disguised as soldiers of the semionovsky regiment presented themselves at the telephone exchange just before the hour of changing guard . they had the bolshevik password and took charge without arousing suspicion . a few minutes later antonov appeared making a round of inspection . him they captured and locked in a small room . when the relief came it was met by a blast of riflefire several being killed . counterrevolution had begun . . . chapter viii counterrevolution next morning sunday the 11th the cossacks entered tsarskoye selo kerensky see app . viii sect . 1 himself riding a white horse and all the churchbells clamouring . from the top of a little hill outside the town could be seen the golden spires and manycoloured cupolas the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread along the dreary plain and beyond the steely gulf of finland . there was no battle . but kerensky made a fatal blunder . at seven in the morning he sent word to the second tsarskoye selo rifles to lay down their arms . the soldiers replied that they would remain neutral but would not disarm . kerensky gave them ten minutes in which to obey . this angered the soldiers for eight months they had been governing themselves by committee and this smacked of the old rgime . . . . a few minutes later cossack artillery opened fire on the barracks killing eight men . from that moment there were no more neutral soldiers in tsarskoye . . . . petrograd woke to bursts of riflefire and the tramping thunder of men marching . under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow . at dawn the military hotel and the telegraph agency had been taken by large forces of yunkers and bloodily recaptured . the telephone station was besieged by sailors who lay behind barricades of barrels boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the morskaya or sheltered themselves at the corner of the gorokhovaya and of st . isaacs square shooting at anything that moved . occasionally an automobile passed in and out flying the red cross flag . the sailors let it pass . . . . albert rhys williams was in the telephone exchange . he went out with the red cross automobile which was ostensibly full of wounded . after circulating about the city the car went by devious ways to the mikhailovsky yunker school headquarters of the counterrevolution . a french officer in the courtyard seemed to be in command . . . . by this means ammunition and supplies were conveyed to the telephone exchange . scores of these pretended ambulances acted as couriers and ammunition trains for the yunkers . five or six armoured cars belonging to the disbanded british armoured car division were in their hands . as louise bryant was going along st . isaacs square one came rolling up from the admiralty on its way to the telephone exchange . at the corner of the gogolia right in front of her the engine stalled . some sailors ambushed behind woodpiles began shooting . the machinegun in the turret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of bullets indiscriminately into the woodpiles and the crowd . in the archway where miss bryant stood seven people were shot dead among them two little boys . suddenly with a shout the sailors leaped up and rushed into the flaming open closing around the monster they thrust their bayonets into the loopholes again and again yelling . . . the chauffeur pretended to be wounded and they let him go freeto run to the duma and swell the tale of bolshevik atrocities . . . .among the dead was a british officer . . . . later the newspapers told of another french officer captured in a yunker armoured car and sent to peterpaul . the french embassy promptly denied this but one of the city councillors told me that he himself had procured the officers release from prison . . . . whatever the official attitude of the allied embassies individual french and british officers were active these days even to the extent of giving advice at executive sessions of the committee for salvation . all day long in every quarter of the city there were skirmishes between yunkers and red guards battles between armoured cars . . . . volleys single shots and the shrill chatter of machineguns could be heard far and near . the iron shutters of the shops were drawn but business still went on . even the movingpicture shows all outside lights dark played to crowded houses . the streetcars ran . the telephones were all working when you called central shooting could be plainly heard over the wire . . . . smolny was cut off but the duma and the committee for salvation were in constant communication with all the yunker schools and with kerensky at tsarskoye . at seven in the morning the vladimir yunker school was visited by a patrol of soldiers sailors and red guards who gave the yunkers twenty minutes to lay down their arms . the ultimatum was rejected . an hour later the yunkers got ready to march but were driven back by a violent fusillade from the corner of the grebetskaya and the bolshoy prospekt . soviet troops surrounded the building and opened fire two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine guns raking it . the yunkers telephoned for help . the cossacks replied that they dare not come because a large body of sailors with two cannon commanded their barracks . the pavlovsk school was surrounded . most of the mikhailov yunkers were fighting in the streets . . . . at halfpast eleven three fieldpieces arrived . another demand to surrender was met by the yunkers shooting down two of the soviet delegates under the white flag . now began a real bombardment . great holes were torn in the walls of the school . the yunkers defended themselves desperately shouting waves of red guards assaulting crumpled under the withering blast . . . . kerensky telephoned from tsarskoye to refuse all parley with the military revolutionary committee . frenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead the soviet troops opened a tornado of steel and flame against the battered building . their own officers could not stop the terrible bombardment . a commissar from smolny named kirilov tried to halt it he was threatened with lynching . the red guards blood was up . at halfpast two the yunkers hoisted a white flag they would surrender if they were guaranteed protection . this was promised . with a rush and a shout thousands of soldiers and red guards poured through windows doors and holes in the wall . before it could be stopped five yunkers were beaten and stabbed to death . the rest about two hundred were taken to peterpaul under escort in small groups so as to avoid notice . on the way a mob set upon one party killing eight more yunkers . . . . more than a hundred red guards and soldiers had fallen . . . . two hours later the duma got a telephone message that the victors were marching toward the injinierny zamokthe engineers school . a dozen members immediately set out to distribute among them armfuls of the latest proclamation of the committee for salvation . several did not come back . . . . all the other schools surrendered without resistance and the yunkers were sent unharmed to peterpaul and cronstadt . . . . the telephone exchange held out until afternoon when a bolshevik armoured car appeared and the sailors stormed the place . shrieking the frightened telephone girls ran to and fro the yunkers tore from their uniforms all distinguishing marks and one offered williams anything for the loan of his overcoat as a disguise . . . . they will massacre us they will massacre us they cried for many of them had given their word at the winter palace not to take up arms against the people . williams offered to mediate if antonov were released . this was immediately done antonov and williams made speeches to the victorious sailors inflamed by their many deadand once more the yunkers went free . . . . all but a few who in their panic tried to flee over the roofs or to hide in the attic and were found and hurled into the street . tired bloody triumphant the sailors and workers swarmed into the switchboard room and finding so many pretty girls fell back in an embarrassed way and fumbled with awkward feet . not a girl was injured not one insulted . frightened they huddled in the corners and then finding themselves safe gave vent to their spite . ugh the dirty ignorant people the fools . . . the sailors and red guards were embarrassed . brutes pigs shrilled the girls indignantly putting on their coats and hats . romantic had been their experience passing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of their dashing young defenders the yunkers many of them members of noble families fighting to restore their beloved tsar these were just common workmen peasants dark people . . . . the commissar of the military revolutionary committee little vishniak tried to persuade the girls to remain . he was effusively polite . you have been badly treated he said . the telephone system is controlled by the municipal duma . you are paid sixty rubles a month and have to work ten hours and more . . . . from now on all that will be changed . the government intends to put the telephones under control of the ministry of posts and telegraphs . your wages will be immediately raised to one hundred and fifty rubles and your workinghours reduced . as members of the workingclass you should be happy members of the workingclass indeed did he mean to infer that there was anything in common between thesethese animalsand us remain not if they offered a thousand rubles . . . haughty and spiteful the girls left the place . . . . the employees of the building the linemen and labourersthey stayed . but the switchboards must be operatedthe telephone was vital . . . . only half a dozen trained operators were available . volunteers were called for a hundred responded sailors soldiers workers . the six girls scurried backward and forward instructing helping scolding . . . . so crippled halting but going the wires slowly began to hum . the first thing was to connect smolny with the barracks and the factories the second to cut off the duma and the yunker schools . . . . late in the afternoon word of it spread through the city and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream fools devils how long do you think you will last wait till the cossacks come dusk was already falling . on the almost deserted nevsky swept by a bitter wind a crowd had gathered before the kazan cathedral continuing the endless debate a few workmen some soldiers and the rest shopkeepers clerks and the like . but lenin wont get germany to make peace cried one . a violent young soldier replied . and whose fault is it your damn kerensky dirty bourgeois to hell with kerensky we dont want him we want lenin . . . . outside the duma an officer with a white armband was tearing down posters from the wall swearing loudly . one read to the population of petrograd at this dangerous hour when the municipal duma ought to use every means to calm the population to assure it bread and other necessities the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets forgetting their duty have turned the duma into a counterrevolutionary meeting trying to raise part of the population against the rest so as to facilitate the victory of kornilovkerensky . instead of doing their duty the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets have transformed the duma into an arena of political attack upon the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies against the revolutionary government of peace bread and liberty . citizens of petrograd we the bolshevik municipal councillors elected by youwe want you to know that the right socialist revolutionaries and the cadets are engaged in counterrevolutionary action have forgotten their duty and are leading the population to famine to civil war . we elected by 183000 votes consider it our duty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is going on in the duma and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for the terrible but inevitable consequences . . . . far away still sounded occasional shots but the city lay quiet cold as if exhausted by the violent spasms which had torn it . in the nicolai hall the duma session was coming to an end . even the truculent duma seemed a little stunned . one after another the commissars reportedcapture of the telephone exchange streetfighting the taking of the vladimir school . . . . the duma said trupp is on the side of the democracy in its struggle against arbitrary violence but in any case whichever side wins the duma will always be against lynchings and torture . . . . konovski cadet a tall old man with a cruel face when the troops of the legal government arrive in petrograd they will shoot down these insurgents and that will not be lynching protests all over the hall even from his own party . here there was doubt and depression . the counterrevolution was being put down . the central committee of the socialist revolutionary party had voted lack of confidence in its officers the left wing was in control avksentiev had resigned . signed . a courier reported that the committee of welcome sent to meet kerensky at the railway station had been arrested . in the streets could be heard the dull rumble of distant cannonading south and southwest . still kerensky did not come . . . only three newspapers were outpravda dielo naroda and novaya zhizn . all of them devoted much space to the new coalition government . the socialist revolutionary paper demanded a cabinet without either cadets or bolsheviki . gorky was hopeful smolny had made concessions . a purely socialist government was taking shapeall elements except the bourgeoisie . as for pravda it sneered we ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose most prominent members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation our coalition is that of the proletariat and the revolutionary army with the poor peasants . . . on the walls a vainglorious announcement of the vikzhel threatening to strike if both sides did not compromise the conquerors of these riots the saviours of the wreck of our country these will be neither the bolsheviki nor the committee for salvation nor the troops of kerenskybut we the union of railwaymen . . . red guards are incapable of handling a complicated business like the railways as for the provisional government it has shown itself incapable of holding the power . . . we refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act by authority of . . . a government based on the confidence of all the democracy . . . . smolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of inexhaustible humanity in action . in trade union headquarters lozovsky introduced me to a delegate of the railway workers of the nicolai line who said that the men were holding huge massmeetings condemning the action of their leaders . all power to the soviets he cried pounding on the table . theoborontsi in the central committee are playing korgravenilovs game . they tried to send a mission to the stavka but we arrested them at minsk . . . . our branch has demanded an allrussian convention and they refuse to call it . . . . the same situation as in the soviets the army committees . one after another the various democratic organisations all over russia were cracking and changing . the cooperatives were torn by internal struggles the meetings of the peasants executive broke up in stormy wrangling even among the cossacks there was trouble . . . . on the top floor the military revolutionary committee was in full blast striking and slacking not . men went in fresh and vigorous night and day and night and day they threw themselves into the terrible machine and came out limp blind with fatigue hoarse and filthy to fall on the floor and sleep . . . . the committee for salvation had been outlawed . great piles of new proclamations see app . viii sect . 2 littered the floor . . . the conspirators who have no support among the garrison or the workingclass above all counted on the suddenness of their attack . their plan was discovered in time by sublieutenant blagonravov thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a soldier of the red guard whose name shall be made public . at the centre of the plot was the committee for salvation . colonel polkovnikov was in command of their forces and the orders were signed by gotz former member of the provisional government allowed at liberty on his word of honour . . . . bringing these facts to the attention of the petrograd population the military revolutionary committee orders the arrest of all concerned in the conspiracy who shall be tried before the revolutionary tribunal . . . . from moscow word that the yunkers and cossacks had surrounded the kremlin and ordered the soviet troops to lay down their arms . the soviet forces complied and as they were leaving the kremlin were set upon and shot down . small forces of bolsheviki had been driven from the telephone and telegraph offices the yunkers now held the centre of the city . . . . but all around them the soviet troops were mustering . streetfighting was slowly gathering way all attempts at compromise had failed . . . . on the side of the soviet ten thousand garrison soldiers and a few red guards on the side of the government six thousand yunkers twentyfive hundred cossacks and two thousand white guards . the petrograd soviet was meeting and next door the new tsayeekah acting on the decrees and orders see app . viii sect . 3 which came down in a steady stream from the council of peoples commissars in session upstairs on the order in which laws are to be ratified and published establishing an eight hour days for workers and lunatcharskys basis for a system of popular education . only a few hundred people were present at the two meetings most of them armed . smolny was almost deserted except for the guards who were busy at the hall windows setting up machineguns to command the flanks of the building . in the tsayeekah a delegate of the vikzhel was speaking we refuse to transport the troops of either party . . . . we have sent a committee to kerensky to say that if he continues to march on petrograd we will break his lines of communication . . . . he made the usual plea for a conference of all the socialist parties to form a new government . . . . kameniev answered discreetly . the bolsheviki would be very glad to attend the conference . the centre of gravity however lay not in composition of such a government but in its acceptance of the programme of the congress of soviets . . . . the tsayeekah had deliberated on the declaration made by the left socialist revolutionaries and the social democrats internationalists and had accepted the proposition of proportional representation at the conference even including delegates from the army committees and the peasants soviets . . . . in the great hall trotzky recounted the events of the day . we offered the vladimir yunkers a chance to surrender he said . we wanted to settle matters without bloodshed . but now that blood has been spilled there is only one waypitiless struggle . it would be childish to think we can win by any other means . . . . the moment is decisive . everybody must cooperate with the military revolutionary committee report where there are stores of barbed wire benzine guns . . . . weve won the power now we must keep it the menshevik yoffe tried to read his partys declaration but trotzky refused to allow a debate about principle . our debates are now in the streets he cried . the decisive step has been taken . we all and i in particular take the responsibility for what is happening . . . . soldiers from the front from gatchina told their stories . one from the death battalion four hundred eightyfirst artillery when the trenches hear of this they will cry this is our government a yunker from peterhof said that he and two others had refused to march against the soviets and when his comrades had returned from the defence of the winter palace they appointed him their commissar to go to smolny and offer their services to the real revolution . . . . then trotzky again fiery indefatigable giving orders answering questions . the petty bourgeoisie in order to defeat the workers soldiers and peasants would combine with the devil himself he said once . many cases of drunkenness had been remarked the last two days . no drinking comrades no one must be on the streets after eight in the evening except the regular guards . all places suspected of having stores of liquor should be searched and the liquor destroyed . see app . viii sect . 4 no mercy to the sellers of liquor . . . . the military revolutionary committee sent for the delegation from the viborg section then for the members from putilov . they clumped out hurriedly . for each revolutionist killed said trotzky we shall kill five counterrevolutionists downtown again . the duma brilliantly illuminated and great crowds pouring in . in the lower hall wailing and cries of grief the throng surged back and forth before the bulletin board where was posted a list of yunkers killed in the days fightingor supposed to be killed for most of the dead afterward turned up safe and sound . . . . up in the alexander hall the committee for salvation held forth . the gold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous the familiar faces of the menshevik and socialist revolutionary intellectuals the hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and diplomats officials of the old rgime and welldressed women . . . . the telephone girls were testifying . girl after girl came to the tribuneoverdressed fashionaping little girls with pinched faces and leaky shoes . girl after girl flushing with pleasure at the applause of the nice people of petrograd of the officers the rich the great names of politicsgirl after girl to narrate her sufferings at the hands of the proletariat and proclaim her loyalty to all that was old established and powerful . . . . the duma was again in session in the nicolai hall . the mayor said hopefully that the petrograd regiments were ashamed of their actions propaganda was making headway . graphic page205 proclamation for wine pogroms revolutionary law and order . a proclamation of the finland regiment in december 1917 announcing desperate remedies for wine pogroms . for translation see appendix 5 . . . . emissaries came and went reporting horrible deeds by the bolsheviki interceding to save the yunkers busily investigating . . . . the bolsheviki said trupp will be conquered by moral force and not by bayonets . . . . . meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front . the enemy had brought up armoured trains mounted with cannon . the soviet forces mostly raw red guards were without officers and without a definite plan . only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them the rest of the garrison was either busy suppressing the yunker revolt guarding the city or undecided what to do . at ten in the evening lenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments who voted overwhelmingly to fight . a committee of five soldiers was elected to serve as general staff and in the small hours of the morning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array . . . . going home i saw them pass swinging along with the regular tread of veterans bayonets in perfect alignment through the deserted streets of the conquered city . . . . at the same time in the headquarters of the vikzhel down on the sadovaya the conference of all the socialist parties to form a new government was under way . abramovitch for the centre mensheviki said that there should be neither conquerors nor conqueredthat bygones should be bygones . . . .in this were agreed all the left wing parties . dan speaking in the name of the right mensheviki proposed to the bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce the red guard to be disarmed and the petrograd garrison to be placed at the orders of the duma the troops of kerensky not to fire a single shot or arrest a single man a ministry of all the socialist parties except the bolsheviki . for smolny riazanov and kameniev declared that a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable but protested at dans proposals . the socialist revolutionaries were divided but the executive committee of the peasantss soviets and the populist socialists flatly refused to admit the bolsheviki . . . . after bitter quarrelling a commission was elected to draw up a workable plan . . . . all that night the commission wrangled and all the next day and the next night . once before on the 9th of november there had been a similar effort at conciliation led by martov and gorky but at the approach of kerensky and the activity of the committee for salvation the right wing of the mensheviki socialist revolutionaries and populist socialists suddenly withdrew . now they were awed by the crushing of the yunker rebellion . . . monday the 12th was a day of suspense . the eyes of all russia were fixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of petrograd where all the available strength of the old order faced the unorganised power of the new the unknown . in moscow a truce had been declared both sides parleyed awaiting the result in the capital . now the delegates to the congress of soviets hurrying on speeding trains to the farthest reaches of asia were coming to their homes carrying the fiery cross . in widespreading ripples news of the miracle spread over the face of the land and in its wake towns cities and far villages stirred and broke soviets and military revolutionary committees against dumas zemstvos and government commissarsred guards against whitestreet fighting and passionate speech . . . . the result waited on the word from petrograd . . . . smolny was almost empty but the duma was thronged and noisy . the old mayor in his dignified way was protesting against the appeal of the bolshevik councillors . the duma is not a centre of counterrevolution he said warmly . the duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties . but at a time when there is no legal power in the land the only centre of order is the municipal selfgovernment . the peaceful population recognises this fact the foreign embassies recognise only such documents as are signed by the mayor of the town . the mind of a european does not admit of any other situation as the municipal selfgovernment is the only organ which is capable of protecting the interests of the citizens . the city is bound to show hospitality to all organisations which desire to profit by such hospitality and therefore the duma cannot prevent the distribution of any newspapers whatever within the duma building . the sphere of our work is increasing and we must be given full liberty of action and our rights must be respected by both parties . . . . we are perfectly neutral . when the telephone exchange was occupied by the yunkers colonel polkovnikov ordered the telephones to smolny disconnected but i protested and the telephones were kept going . . . . at this there was ironic laughter from the bolshevik benches and imprecations from the right . and yet went on schreider they look upon us as counterrevolutionaries and report us to the population . they deprive us of our means of transport by taking away our last motorcars . it will not be our fault if there is famine in the town . protests are of no use . . . . kobozev bolshevik member of the town board was doubtful whether the military revolutionary committee had requisitioned the municipal automobiles . even granting the fact it was probably done by some unauthorised individual in the emergency . the mayor he continued tells us that we must not make political meetings out of the duma . but every menshevik and socialist revolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda and at the door they distribute their illegal newspapers iskri sparks soldatski golos and rabotchaya gazeta inciting to insurrection . what if we bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papers here but this shall not be for we respect the duma . we have not attacked the municipal selfgovernment and we shall not do so . but you have addressed an appeal to the population and we are entitled also to do so . . . . followed him shingariov cadet who said that there could be no common language with those who were liable to be brought before the attorney general for indictment and who must be tried on the charge of treason . . . . he proposed again that all bolshevik members should be expelled from the duma . this was tabled however for there were no personal charges against the members and they were active in the municipal administration . then two mensheviki internationalists declaring that the appeal of the bolshevik councillors was a direct incitement to massacre . if everything that is against the bolsheviki is counterrevolutionary said pinkevitch then i do not know the difference between revolution and anarchy . . . . the bolsheviki are depending upon the passions of the unbridled masses we have nothing but moral force . we will protest against massacres and violence from both sides as our task is to find a peaceful issue . the notice posted in the streets under the heading to the pillory which calls upon the people to destroy the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries said nazariev is a crime which you bolsheviki will not be able to wash away . yesterdays horrors are but a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation . . . . i have always tried to reconcile you with the other parties but at present i feel for you nothing but contempt the bolshevik councillors were on their feet shouting angrily assailed by hoarse hateful voices and waving arms . . . . outside the hall i ran into the city engineer the menshevik gomberg and three or four reporters . they were all in high spirits . see they said . the cowards are afraid of us . they dont dare arrest the duma their military revolutionary committee doesnt dare to send a commissar into this building . why on the corner of the sadovaya today i saw a red guard try to stop a boy selling soldatski golos . . . . the boy just laughed at him and a crowd of people wanted to lynch the bandit . its only a few hours more now . even if kerensky wouldnt come they havent the men to run a government . absurd i understand theyre even fighting among themselves at smolny a socialist revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside . i know where the committee for salvation is hiding he said . do you want to go and talk with them by this time it was dusk . the city had again settled down to normalshopshutters up lights shining and on the streets great crowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing . . . . at number 86 nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard surrounded by tall apartment buildings . at the door of apartment 229 my friend knocked in a peculiar way . there was a sound of scuffling an inside door slammed then the front door opened a crack and a womans face appeared . after a minutes observation she led us ina placidlooking middleaged lady who at once cried kyril its all right in the diningroom where a samovar steamed on the table and there were plates full of bread and raw fish a man in uniform emerged from behind the windowcurtains and another dressed like a workman from a closet . they were delighted to meet an american reporter . with a certain amount of gusto both said that they would certainly be shot if the bolsheviki caught them . they would not give me their names but both were socialist revolutionaries . . . . why i asked do you publish such lies in your newspapers without taking offence the officer replied yes i know but what can we do he shrugged . you must admit that it is necessary for us to create a certain frame of mind in the people . . . . the other man interrupted . this is merely an adventure on the part of the bolsheviki . they have no intellectuals . . . . the ministries wont work . . . . russia is not a city but a whole country . . . . realising that they can only last a few days we have decided to come to the aid of the strongest force opposed to themkerenskyand help to restore order . that is all very well i said . but why do you combine with the cadets the pseudoworkman smiled frankly . to tell you the truth at this moment the masses of the people are following the bolsheviki . we have no followingnow . we cant mobilise a handful of soldiers . there are no arms available . . . . the bolsheviki are right to a certain extent there are at this moment in russia only two parties with any forcethe bolsheviki and the reactionaries who are all hiding under the coattails of the cadets . the cadets think they are using us but it is really we who are using the cadets . when we smash the bolsheviki we shall turn against the cadets . . . . will the bolsheviki be admitted into the new government he scratched his head . thats a problem he admitted . of course if they are not admitted theysll probably do this all over again . at any rate they will have a chance to hold the balance of power in the constituentthat is if there is a constituent . and then too said the officer that brings up the question of admitting the cadets into the new governmentand for the same reasons . you know the cadets do not really want the constituent assemblynot if the bolsheviki can be destroyed now . he shook his head . it is not easy for us russians politics . you americans are born politicians you have had politics all your lives . but for uswell it has only been a year you know what do you think of kerensky i asked . oh kerensky is guilty of the sins of the provisional government answered the other man . kerensky himself forced us to accept coalition with the bourgeoisie . if he had resigned as he threatened it would have meant a new cabinet crisis only sixteen weeks before the constituent assembly and that we wanted to avoid . but didnt it amount to that anyway yes but how were we to know they tricked usthe kerenskys and avksentievs . gotz is a little more radical . i stand with tchernov who is a real revolutionist . . . . why only today lenin sent word that he would not object to tchernov entering the government . we wanted to get rid of the kerensky government too but we thought it better to wait for the constituent . . . . at the beginning of this affair i was with the bolsheviki but the central committee of my party voted unanimously against itand what could i do it was a matter of party discipline . . . . in a week the bolshevik government will go to pieces if the socialist revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait the government would fall into their hands . but if we wait a week the country will be so disorganised that the german imperialists will be victorious . that is why we began our revolt with only two regiments of soldiers promising to support usand they turned against us . . . . that left only the yunkers . . . . how about the cossacks the officer sighed . they did not move . at first they said they would come out if they had infantry support . they said moreover that they had their men with kerensky and that they were doing their part . . . . then too they said that the cossacks were always accused of being the hereditary enemies of democracy . . . . and finally the bolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land . there is no danger to us . we remain neutral . during this talk people were constantly entering and leavingmost of them officers their shoulderstraps torn off . we could see them in the hall and hear their low vehement voices . occasionally through the halfdrawn portires we caught a glimpse of a door opening into a bathroom where a heavilybuilt officer in a colonels uniform sat on the toilet writing something on a pad held in his lap . i recognised colonel polkovnikov former commandant of petrograd for whose arrest the military revolutionary committee would have paid a fortune . our programme said the officer . this is it . land to be turned over to the land committees . workmen to have full representation in the control of industry . an energetic peace programme but not an ultimatum to the world such as the bolsheviki issued . the bolsheviki cannot keep their promises to the masses even in the country itself . we wont let them . . . . they stole our land programme in order to get the support of the peasants . that is dishonest . if they had waited for the constituent assembly it doesnt matter about the constituent assembly broke in the officer . if the bolsheviki want to establish a socialist state here we cannot work with them in any event kerensky made the great mistake . he let the bolsheviki know what he was going to do by announcing in the council of the republic that he had ordered their arrest . . . . but what i said do you intend to do now the two men looked at one another . you will see in a few days . if there are enough troops from the front on our side we shall not compromise with the bolsheviki . if not perhaps we shall be forced to . . . . out again on the nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulging with people its platforms bent down from the weight and scraping along the ground which crawled with agonising slowness the long miles to smolny . meshkovsky a neat frail little man was coming down the hall looking worried . the strikes in the ministries he told us were having their effect . for instance the council of peoples commissars had promised to publish the secret treaties but neratov the functionary in charge had disappeared taking the documents with him . they were supposed to be hidden in the british embassy . . . . worst of all however was the strike in the banks . without money said menzhinsky we are helpless . the wages of the railroad men of the postal and telegraph employees must be paid . . . . the banks are closed and the key to the situation the state bank is also shut . all the bankclerks in russia have been bribed to stop work . . . . but lenin has issued an order to dynamite the state bank vaults and there is a decree just out ordering the private banks to open tomorrow or we will open them ourselves the petrograd soviet was in full swing thronged with armed men trotzky reporting the cossacks are falling back from krasnoye selo . sharp exultant cheering . but the battle is only beginning . at pulkovo heavy fighting is going on . all available forces must be hurried there . . . . from moscow bad news . the kremlin is in the hands of the yunkers and the workers have only a few arms . the result depends upon petrograd . at the front the decrees on peace and land are provoking great enthusiasm . kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales of petrograd burning and bloody of women and children massacred by the bolsheviki . but no one believes him . . . . the cruisers oleg avrora and respublica are anchored in the neva their guns trained on the approaches to the city . . . . why arent you out there with the red guards shouted a rough voice . im going now answered trotzky and left the platform . his face a little paler than usual he passed down the side of the room e room surrounded by eager friends and hurried out to the waiting automobile . kameniev now spoke describing the proceedings of the reconciliation conference . the armistice conditions proposed by the mensheviki he said had been contemptuously rejected . even the branches of the railwaymens union had voted against such a proposition . . . . now that weve won the power and are sweeping all russia he declared all they ask of us are three little things 1 . to surrender the power . 2 . to make the soldiers continue the war . 3 . to make the peasants forget about the land . . . . lenin appeared for a moment to answer the accusations of the socialist revolutionaries they charge us with stealing their land programme . . . . if that is so we bow to them . it is good enough for us . . . . so the meeting roared on leader after leader explaining exhorting arguing soldier after soldier workman after workman standing up to speak his mind and his heart . . . . the audience flowed changing and renewed continually . from time to time men came in yelling for the members of such and such a detachment to go to the front others relieved wounded or coming to smolny for arms and equipment poured in . . . . it was almost three oclock in the morning when as we left the hall holtzman of the military revolutionary committee came running down the hall with a transfigured face . its all right he shouted grabbing my hands . telegram from the front . kerensky is smashed look at this he held out a sheet of paper scribbled hurriedly in pencil and then seeing we couldnt read it he declaimed aloud pulkovo . staff . 2 .10 a .m . the night of october 30th to 31st will go down in history . the attempt of kerensky to move counterrevolutionary troops against the capital of the revolution has been decisively repulsed . kerensky is retreating we are advancing . the soldiers sailors and workers of petrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their hands enforce the will and authority of the democracy . the bourgeoisie tried to isolate the revolutionary army . kerensky attempted to break it by the force of the cossacks . both plans met a pitiful defeat . the grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracy closed the ranks of the army and hardened its will . all the country from now on will be convinced that the power of the soviets is no ephemeral thing but an invincible fact . . . . the repulse of kerensky is the repulse of the landowners the bourgeoisie and the kornilovists in general . the repulse of kerensky is the confirmation of the right of the people to a peaceful free life to land bread and power . the pulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the cause of the workers and peasantss revolution . there is no return to the past . before us are struggles obstacles and sacrifices . but the road is clear and victory is certain . revolutionary russia and the soviet power can be proud of their pulkovo detachment acting under the command of colonel walden . eternal memory to those who fell glory to the warriors of the revolution the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to the people long live revolutionary popular socialist russia in the name of the council l . trotzky peoples commissar . . . . driving home across znamensky square we made out an unusual crowd in front of the nicolai railway station . several thousand sailors were massed there bristling with rifles . standing on the steps a member of the vikzhel was pleading with them . comrades we cannot carry you to moscow . we are neutral . we do not carry troops for either side . we cannot take you to moscow where already there is terrible civil war . . . . all the seething square roared at him the sailors began to surge forward . suddenly another door was flung wide in it stood two or three brakeman a fireman or so . this way comrades cried one . we will take you to moscowor vladivostok if you like long live the revolution chapter ix victory order number i to the troops of the pulkovo detachment . november 13 1917 . 38 minutes past 9 a . m . after a cruel fight the troops of the pulkovo detachment completely routed the counterrevolutionary forces who retreated from their positions in disorder and under cover of tsarskoye selo fell back toward pavlovsk ii and gatchina . our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of tsarskoye selo and the station alexandrovskaya . the colpinno detachment was on our left the krasnoye selo detachment to our right . i ordered the pulkovo forces to occupy tsarskoye selo to fortify its approaches especially on the side of gatchina . also to pass and occupy pavlovskoye fortifying its southern side and to take up the railroad as far as dno . the troops must take all measures to strengthen the positions occupied by them arranging trenches and other defensive works . they must enter into close liaison with the detachments of colpinno and krasnoye selo and also with the staff of the commander in chief for the defence of petrograd . signed commander in chief aver all forces acting against the counterrevolutionary troops of kerensky lieutenantcolonel muraviov . tuesday morning . but how is this only two days ago the petrograd campagna was full of leaderless bands wandering aimlessly without food without artillery without a plan . what had fused that disorganised mass of undisciplined red guards and soldiers without officers into an army obedient to its own elected high command tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and cossack cavalry see app . ix sect . 1 people in revolt have a way of defying military precedent . the ragged armies of the french revolution are not forgottenvalmy and the lines of weissembourg . massed against the soviet forces were yunkers cossacks landowners nobility black hundredsthe tsar come again okhrana and siberian chains and the vast and terrible menace of the germans . . . . victory in the words of carlyle meant apotheosis and millennium without end sunday night the commissars of the military revolutionary committee returning desperately from the field the garrison of petrograd elected its committee of five its battle staff three soldiers and two officers all certified free from counterrevolutionary taint . colonel muraviov expatriot was in commandan efficient man but to be carefully watched . at colpinno at obukhovo at pulkovo and krasnoye selo were formed provisional detachments increased in size as the stragglers came in from the surrounding countrymixed soldiers sailors and red guards parts of regiments infantry cavalry and artillery all together and a few armoured cars . day broke and the pickets of kerenskys cossacks came in touch . scattered riflefire summons to surrender . over the bleak plain on the cold quiet air spread the sound of battle falling upon the ears of roving bands as they gathered about their little fires waiting . . . . so it was beginning they made toward the battle and the worker hordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace . . . . thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angry human swarms to be met by commissars and assigned positions or work to do . this was their battle for their world the officers in command were elected by them . for the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will . . . . those who participated in the fighting described to me how the sailors fought until they ran out of cartridges and then stormed how the untrained workmen rushed the charging cossacks and tore them from their horses how the anonymous hordes of the people gathering in the darkness around the battle rose like a tide and poured over the enemy . . . . before midnight of monday the cossacks broke and were fleeing leaving their artillery behind them and the army of the proletariat on a long ragged front moved forward and rolled into tsarskoye before the enemy had a chance to destroy the great government wireless station from which now the commissars of smolny were hurling out to the world paeans of triumph . . . . to all soviets of workers and soldiers deputies the 12th of november in a bloody combat near tsarskoye selo the revolutionary army defeated the counterrevolutionary troops of kerensky and kornilov . in the name of the revolutionary government i order all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of the revolutionary democracy and to take all measures to arrest kerensky and also to oppose any adventure which might menace the conquests of the revolution and the victory of the proletariat . long live the revolutionary army muraviov . news from the provinces . . . . at sevastopol the local soviet had assumed the power a huge meeting of the sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced their officers to line up and swear allegiance to the new government . at nizhni novgorod the soviet was in control . from kazan came reports of a battle in the streets yunkers and a brigade of artillery against the bolshevik garrison . . . . desperate fighting had broken out again in moscow . the yunkers and white guards held the kremlin and the centre of the town beaten upon from all sides by the troops of the military revolutionary committee . the soviet artillery was stationed in skobeliev square bombarding the city duma building the prefecture and the hotel metropole . the cobblestones of the tverskaya and nikitskaya had been torn up for trenches and barricades . a hail of machinegun fire swept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses . there were no lights no telephones the bourgeois population lived in the cellars . . . . the last bulletin said that the military revolutionary committee had delivered an ultimatum to the committee of public safety demanding the immediate surrender of the kremlin or bombardment would follow . bombard the kremlin cried the ordinary citizen . they dare not from vologda to chita in far siberia from pskov to sevastopol on the black sea in great cities and little villages civil war burst into flame . from thousands of factories peasant communes regiments and armies ships on the wide sea greetings poured into petrogradgreetings to the government of the people . the cossack government at novotcherkask telegraphed to kerensky the government of the cossack troops invites the provisional government and the members of the council of the republic to come if possible to novotcherkask where we can organise in common the struggle against the bolsheviki . in finland also things were stirring . the soviet of helsingfors and the tsentrobalt central committee of the baltic fleet jointly proclaimed a state of siege and declared that all attempts to interfere with the bolshevik forces and all armed resistance to its orders would be severely repressed . at the same time the finnish railway union called a countrywide general strike to put into operation the laws passed by the socialist diet of june 1917 dissolved by kerensky . . . . early in the morning i went out to smolny . going up the long wooden sidewalk from the outer gate i saw the first thin hesitating snowflakes fluttering down from the grey windless sky . snow cried the soldier at the door grinning with delight . good for the health inside the long gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemed deserted . no one moved in all the enormous pile . a deep uneasy sound came to my ears and looking around i noticed that everywhere on the floor along the walls men were sleeping . rough dirty men workers and soldiers spattered and caked with mud sprawled alone or in heaps in the careless attitudes of death . some wore ragged bandages marked with blood . guns and cartridgebelts were scattered about . . . . the victorious proletarian army in the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk . the air was foul . through the clouded windows a pale light streamed . a battered samovar cold stood on the counter and many glasses holding dregs of tea . beside them lay a copy of the military revolutionary committees last bulletin upside down scrawled with painful handwriting . it was a memorial written by some soldier to his comrades fallen in the fight against kerensky just as he had set it down before falling on the floor to sleep . the writing was blurred with what looked like tears . . . . alexei vinogradov d . maskvin s . stolbikov a . voskressensky d .

leonsky sleep warrior eagles sleep with peaceful soul . you have deserved our own ones happiness and eternal peace . under the earth of the grave you have straitly closed your ranks . sleep citizens only the military revolutionary committee still functioned unsleeping . skripnik emerging from the inner room said that gotz had been arrested but had flatly denied signing the proclamation of the committee for salvation as had avksentiev and the committee for salvation itself had repudiated the appeal to the garrison . there was still disafiection among the city regiments skripnik reported the volhynsky regiment had refused to fight against kerensky . several detachments of neutral troops with tchernov at their head were at gatchina trying to persuade kerensky to halt his attack on petrograd . skripnik laughed . there can be no neutrals now he said . weve won his sharp bearded face glowed with an almost religious exaltation . more than sixty delegates have arrived from the front with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops on the rumanian front who have not been heard from . the army committees have suppressed all news from petrograd but we now have a regular system of couriers . . . . graphic page224 certificate approving telegram transmission order given me at staff headquarters by command of the council of peoples commissars to transmit the

bonchbruevitch down in the front hall kameniev was just entering worn out by the allnight session of the conference to form a new government but happy . already the socialist revolutionaries are inclined to admit us into the new government he told me . the right wing groups are frightened by the revolutionary tribunals they demand in a sort of panic that we dissolve them before going any further . . . . we have accepted the proposition of the vikzhel to form a homogeneous socialist ministry and theyre working on that now . you see it all springs from our victory . when we were down they wouldt have us at any price not everybodys in favour of some agreement with the soivets . . . . what we need is a really decisive victory . kerensky wants an armistice but hell have to surrender see app . ix sect . 2 . . . . that was the temper of the bolshevik leaders . to a foreign journalist who asked trotzky what statement he had to make to the world trotzky replied at this moment the only statement possible is the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon but there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide of victory the question of finances . instead of opening the banks as had been ordered by the military revolutionary committee the union of bank employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike . smolny had demanded some thirtyfive millions of rubles from the state bank and the cashier had locked the vaults only paying out money to the representatives of the provisional government . the reactionaries were using the state bank as a political weapon for instance when the vikzhel demanded money to pay the salaries of the employees of the government railroads it was told to apply to smolny . . . . i went to the state bank to see the new commissar a redhaired ukrainean bolshevik named petrovitch . he was trying to bring order out of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the striking clerks . in all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteer workers soldiers and sailors their tongues sticking out of their mouths in the intensity of their effort were poring over the great ledgers with a bewildered air . . . . the duma building was crowded . there were still isolated cases of defiance toward the new government but they were rare . the central land committee had appealed to the peasants ordering them not to recognise the land decree passed by the congress of the soviets because it would cause confusion and civil war . mayor schreider announced that because of the bolshevik insurrection the elections to the constituent assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed . two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds shocked by the ferocity of the civil war first a truce to the bloodshed see app . ix sect . 3second the creation of a new government . there was no longer any talk of destroying the bolshevikiand very little about excluding them from the government except from the populist socialists and the peasants soviets . even the central army committee at the stavka the most determined enemy of smolny telephoned from moghilev if to constitute the new ministry it is necessary to come to an understanding with the bolsheviki we agree to admit them in a minority to the cabinet . pravda ironically calling attention to kerenskys humanitarian sentiments published his despatch to the committee for salvation in accord with the proposals of the committee for salvation and all the democratic organisations united around it i have halted all military action against the rebels . a delegate of the committee has been sent to enter into negotiations . take all measures to stop the useless shedding of blood . the vikzhel sent a telegram to all russia the conference of the union of railway workers with the representatives of both the belligerent parties who admit the necessity of an agreement protest energetically against the use of political terrorism in the civil war especially when it is carried on between different factions of the revolutionary democracy and declare that political terrorism in whatever form is in contradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a new government . . . . graphic page227 leaflet popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the bolshevik insurrection containing rhymes and jokes about the defeated bourgeoisie and the moderate socialist leaders called how the boorzhui bourgeoisie lost the power . delegations from the conference were sent to the front to gatchina . in the conference itself everything seemed on the point of final settlement . it had even been decided to elect a provisional peoples council composed of about four hundred membersseventyfive representing smolny seventyfive the old tsayeekah and the rest split up among the town dumas the trade unions land committees and political parties . tchernov was mentioned as the new premier . lenin and trotzky rumour said were to be excluded . . . . about noon i was again in front of smolny talking with the driver of an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front . could i go with him certainly he was a volunteer a university student and as we rolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases of execrable german also gut wir nach die kasernen zu essen gehen i made out that there would be lunch at some barracks . on the kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded by military buildings and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit by one window . at a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers eating shtchi cabbage soup from a great tin washtub with wooden spoons and talking loudly with much laughter . welcome to the battalion committee of the sixth reserve engineers battalion cried my friend and introduced me as an american socialist . whereat every one rose to shake my hand and one old soldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss . a wooden spoon was produced and i took my place at the table . another tub full of kasha was brought in a huge loaf of black bread and of course the inevitable teapots . at once every one began asking me questions about america was it true that people in a free country sold their votes for money if so how did they get what they wanted how about this tammany was it true that in a free country a little group of people could control a whole city and exploited it for their personal benefit why did the people stand it even under the tsar such things could not happen in russia true here there was always graft but to buy and sell a whole city full of people and in a free country had the people no revolutionary feeling i tried to explain that in my country people tried to change things by law . of course nodded a young sergeant named baklanov who spoke french . but you have a highly developed capitalist class then the capitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts . how then can the people change things i am open to conviction for i do not know your country but to me it is incredible . . . . i said that i was going to tsarskoye selo . i too said baklanov suddenly . and iand i the whole roomful decided on the spot to go to tsarskoye selo . just then came a knock on the door . it opened and in it stood the figure of the colonel . no one rose but all shouted a greeting . may i come in asked the colonel . prosim prosim they answered heartily . he entered smiling a tall distinguished figure in a goatskin cape embroidered with gold . i think i heard you say that you were going to tsarskoye selo comrades he said . could i go with you baklanov considered . i do not think there is anything to be done here today he answered . yes comrade we shall be very glad to have you . the colonel thanked him and sat down filling a glass of tea . in a low voice for fear of wounding the colonels pride baklanov explained to me . you see i am the chairman of the committee . we control the battalion absolutely except in action when the colonel is delegated by us to command . in action his orders must be obeyed but he is strictly responsible to us . in barracks he must ask our permission before taking any action . . . . you might call him our executive officer . . . . arms were distributed to us revolvers and rifleswe might meet some cossacks you knowand we all piled into the ambulance together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front . straight down the liteiny we rattled and along the zagorodny prospekt . next to me sat a youth with the shoulderstraps of a lieutenant who seemed to speak all european languages with equal fluency . he was a member of the battalion committee . i am not a bolshevik he assured me emphatically . my family is a very ancient and noble one . i myself am you might say a cadet . . . . but how i began bewildered . oh yes i am a member of the committee . i make no secret of my political opinions but the others do not mind because they know i do not believe in opposing the will of the majority . . . . i have refused to take any action in the present civil war however for i do not believe in taking up arms against my brother russians . . . . provocator kornilovitz the others cried at him gaily slapping him on the shoulder . . . . passing under the huge grey stone archway of the moskovsky gate covered with golden hieroglyphics ponderous imperial eagles and the names of tsars we sped out on the wide straight highway grey with the first light fall of snow . it was thronged with red guards stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front shouting and singing and others greyfaced and muddy coming back . most of them seemed to be mere boys . women with spades some with rifles and bandoleers others wearing the red cross on their armbandsthe bowed toilworm women of the slums . squads of soldiers marching out of step with an affectionate jeer for the red guards sailors grimlooking children with bundles of food for their fathers and mothers all these coming and going trudged through the whitened mud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep . we passed cannon jingling southward with their caissons trucks bound both ways bristling with armed men ambulances full of wounded from the direction of the battle and once a peasant cart creaking slowly along in which sat a whitefaced boy bent over his shattered stomach and screaming monotonously . in the fields on either side women and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wire entanglements . back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically and the pale sun came out . across the flat marshy plain petrograd glittered . to the right white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles to the left tall chimneys some pouring out black smoke and beyond a lowering sky over finland . on each side of us were churches monasteries . . . . occasionally a monk was visible silently watching the pulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road . at pulkovo the road divided and there we halted in the midst of a great crowd where the human streams poured from three directions friends meeting excited and congratulatory describing the battle to one another . a row of houses facing the crossroads was marked with bullets and the earth was trampled into mud half a mile around . the fighting had been furious here . . . . in the near distance riderless cossack horses circled hungrily for the grass of the plain had died long ago . right in front of us an awkward red guard was trying to ride one falling off again and again to the childlike delight of a thousand rough men . the left road along which the remnants of the cossacks had retreated led up a little hill to a hamlet where there was a glorious view of the immense plain grey as a windless sea tumultuous clouds towering over and the imperial city disgorging its thousands along all the roads . far over to the left lay the little hill of kranoye selo the paradeground of the imperial guards summer camp and the imperial dairy . in the middle distance nothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries and convents some isolated factories and several large buildings with unkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages . . . . here said the driver as we went on over a barren hill here was where vera slutskaya died . yes the bolshevik member of the duma . it happened early this morning . she was in an automobile with zalkind and another man . there was a truce and they started for the front trenches . they were talking and laughing when all of a sudden from the armoured train in which kerensky himself was riding somebody saw the automobile and fired a cannon . the shell struck vera slutskaya and killed her . . . . and so we came into tsarskoye all bustling with the swaggering heroes of the proletarian horde . now the palace where the soviet had met was a busy place . red guards and sailors filled the courtyard sentries stood at the doors and a stream of couriers and commissars pushed in and out . in the soviet room a samovar had been set up and fifty or more workers soldiers sailors and officers stood around drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices . in one corner two clumsyhanded workingmen were trying to make a multigraphing machine go . at the centre table the huge dybenko bent over a map marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils . in his free hand he carried as always the enormous bluesteel revolver . anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded away with one finger every little while he would pause pick up the revolver and lovingly spin the chamber . a couch lay along the wall and on this was stretched a young workman . two red guards were bending over him but the rest of the company did not pay any attention . in his breast was a hole through his clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heartbeat . his eyes were closed and his young bearded face was greenishwhite . faintly and slowly he still breathed with every breath sighing mir boudit mir boudit peace is coming peace is coming dybenko looked up as we came in . ah he said to baklanov . comrade will you go up to the commandants headquarters and take charge wait i will write you credentials . he went to the typewriter and slowly picked out the letters . the new commandant of tsarskoye selo and i went toward the ekaterina palace baklanov very excited and important . in the same ornate white room some red guards were rummaging curiously around while my old friend the colonel stood by the window biting his moustache . he greeted me like a longlost brother . at a table near the door sat the french bessarabian . the bolsheviki had ordered him to remain and continue his work . what could i do he muttered . people like myself cannot fight on either side in such a war as this no matter how much we may instinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob . . . . i only regret that i am so far from my mother in bessarabia baklanov was formally taking over the office from the commandant . here said the colonel nervously are the keys to the desk . a red guard interrupted . wheres the money he asked rudely . the colonel seemed surprised . money money ah you mean the chest . there it is said the colonel just as i found it when i took possession three days ago . keys the colonel shrugged . i have no keys . the red guard sneered knowingly . very convenient he said . let us open the chest said baklanov . bring an axe . here is an american comrade . let him smash the chest open and write down what he finds there . i swung the axe . the wooden chest was empty . lets arrest him said the red guard venomously . he is kerenskys man . he has stolen the money and given it to kerensky . baklanov did not want to . oh no he said . it was the kornilovitz before him . he is not to blame . the devil cried the red guard . he is kerenskys man i tell you . if you wont arrest him then we will and well take him to petrograd and put him in peterpaul where he belongs at this the other red guards growled assent . with a piteous glance at us the colonel was led away . . . . down in front of the soviet palace an autotruck was going to the front . half a dozen red guards some sailors and a soldier or two under command of a huge workman clambered in and shouted to me to come along . red guards issued from headquarters each of them staggering under an armload of small corrugatediron bombs filled with grubitwhich they say is ten times as strong and five times as sensitive as dynamite these they threw into the truck . a threeinch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of the truck with bits of rope and wire . we started with a shout at top speed of course the heavy truck swaying from side to side . the cannon leaped from one wheel to the other and the grubit bombs went rolling back and forth over our feet fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash . the big red guard whose name was vladimir nicolaievitch plied me with questions about america . why did america come into the war are the american workers ready to throw over the capitalists what is the situation in the mooney case now will they extradite berkman to san francisco and other very difficult to answer all delivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck while we held on to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs . occasionally a patrol tried to stop us . soldiers ran out into the road before us shouted shtoi and threw up their guns . we paid no attention . the devil take you cried the red guards . we dont stop for anybody were red guards and we thundered imperiously on while vladimir nicolaievitch bellowed to me about the internationalisation of the panama canal and such matters . . . . about five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back and slowed down . wheres the front brothers the foremost sailor halted and scratched his head . this morning he said it was about half a kilometer down the road . but the damn thing isnt anywhere now . we walked and walked and walked but we couldnt find it . they climbed into the truck and we proceeded . it must have been about a mile further that vladimir nicolaievitch cocked his ear and shouted to the chauffeur to stop . firing he said . do you hear it for a moment dead silence and then a little ahead and to the left three shots in rapid succession . along here the side of the road was heavily wooded . very much excited now we crept along speaking in whispers until the truck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from . descending we spread out and every man carrying his rifle went stealthily into the forest . two comrades meanwhile detached the cannon and slewed it around until it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs . it was silent in the woods . the leaves were gone and the treetrunks were a pale wan colour in the low sickly autumn sun . not a thing moved except the ice of little woodland pools shivering under our feet . was it an ambush we went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin and paused . beyond in a little clearing three soldiers sat around a small fire perfectly oblivious . vladimir nicolaievitch stepped forward . zrazvuitye comrades he greeted while behind him one cannon twenty rifles and a truckload of grubit bombs hung by a hair . the soldiers scrambled to their feet . what was the shooting going on around here one of the soldiers answered looking relieved why we were just shooting a rabbit or two comrade . . . . the truck hurtled on toward romanov through the bright empty day . at the first crossroads two soldiers ran out in front of us waving their rifles . we slowed down and stopped . passes comrades the red guards raised a great clamour . we are red guards . we dont need any passes . . . . go on never mind them but a sailor objected . this is wrong comrades . we must have revolutionary discipline . suppose some counterrevolutionaries came along in a truck and said we dont need any passes the comrades dont know you . at this there was a debate . one by one however the sailors and soldiers joined with the first . grumbling each red guard produced his dirty bumaga paper . all were alike except mine which had been issued by the revolutionary staff at smolny . the sentries declared that i must go with them . the red guards objected strenuously but the sailor who had spoken first insisted . this comrade we know to be a true comrade he said . but there are orders of the committee and these orders must be obeyed . that is revolutionary discipline . . . . in order not to make any trouble i got down from the truck and watched it disappear careening down the road all the company waving farewell . the soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment and then led me to a wall against which they placed me . it flashed upon me suddenly they were going to shoot me in all three directions not a human being was in sight . the only sign of life was smoke from the chimney of a datchya a rambling wooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road . the two soldiers were walking out into the road . desperately i ran after them . but comrades see here is the seal of the military revolutionary committee they stared stupidly at my pass then at each other . it is different from the others said one sullenly . we cannot read brother . i took him by the arm . come i said . lets go to that house . some one there can surely read . they hesitated . no said one . the other looked me over . why not he muttered . after all it is a serious crime to kill an innocent man . we walked up to the front door of the house and knocked . a short stout woman opened it and shrank back in alarm babbling i dont know anything about them i dont know anything about them one of my guards held out the pass . she screamed . just to read it comrade . hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud swiftly the bearer of this pass john reed is a representative of the american socialdemocracy an internationalist . . . . out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation . we must take you to the regimental committee they said . in the fastdeepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road . occasionally we met squads of soldiers who stopped and surrounded me with looks of menace handling my pass around and arguing violently as to whether or not i should be killed . . . . it was dark when we came to the barracks of the second tsarskoye selo rifles low sprawling buildings huddled along the postroad . a number of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions . a spy a provocator we mounted a winding stair and emerged into a great bare room with a huge stove in the centre and rows of cots on the floor where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards talking singing and asleep . in the roof was a jagged hole made by kerenskys cannon . . . . i stood in the doorway and a sudden silence ran among the groups who turned and stared at me . of a sudden they began to move slowly and then with a rush thundering with faces full of hate . comrades comrades yelled one of my guards . committee committee the throng halted banked around me muttering . out of them shouldered a lean youth wearing a red armband . who is this he asked roughly . the guards explained . give me the paper he read it carefully glancing at me with keen eyes . then he smiled and handed me the pass . comrades this is an american comrade . i am chairman of the committee and i welcome you to the regiment . . . . a sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting and they pressed forward to shake my hand . you have not dined here we have had our dinner . you shall go to the officers club where there are some who speak your language . . . . he led me across the courtyard to the door of another building . an aristocraticlooking youth with the shoulder straps of a lieutenant was entering . the chairman presented me and shaking hands went back . i am stepan georgevitch morovsky at your service said the lieutenant in perfect french . from the ornate entrance hall a ceremonial staircase led upward lighted by glittering lustres . on the second floor billiardrooms cardrooms a library opened from the hall . we entered the diningroom at a long table in the centre of which sat about twenty officers in full uniform wearing their gold and silverhandled swords the ribbons and crosses of imperial decorations . all rose politely as i entered and made a place for me beside the colonel a large impressive man with a grizzled beard . orderlies were deftly serving dinner . the atmosphere was that of any officers mess in europe . where was the revolution you are not bolsheviki i asked morovsky . a smile went around the table but i caught one or two glancing furtively at the orderly . no answered my friend . there is only one bolshevik officer in this regiment . he is in petrograd tonight . the colonel is a menshevik . captain kherlov there is a cadet . i myself am a socialist revolutionary of the right wing . . . . i should say that most of the officers in the army are not bolsheviki but like me they believe in democracy they believe that they must follow the soldiermasses . . . . dinner over maps were brought and the colonel spread them out on the table . the rest crowded around to see . here said the colonel pointing to pencil marks were our positions this morning . vladimir kyrilovitch where is your company captain kherlov pointed . according to orders we occupied the position along this road . karsavin relieved me at five oclock . just then the door of the room opened and there entered the chairman of the regimental committee with another soldier . they joined the group behind the colonel peering at the map . map . good said the colonel . now the cossacks have fallen back ten kilometres in our sector . i do not think it is necessary to take up advanced positions . gentlemen for tonight you will hold the present line strengthening the positions by if you please interrupted the chairman of the regimental committee . the orders are to advance with all speed and prepare to engage the cossacks north of gatchina in the morning . a crushing defeat is necessary . kindly make the proper dispositions . there was a short silence . the colonel again turned to the map . very well he said in a different voice . stepan georgevitch you will please rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil he gave his orders while a sergeant made shorthand notes . the sergeant then withdrew and ten minutes later returned with the orders typewritten and one carbon copy . the chairman of the committee studied the map with a copy of the orders before him . all right he said rising . folding the carbon copy he put it in his pocket . then he signed the other stamped it with a round seal taken from his pocket and presented it to the colonel . . . . here was the revolution i returned to the soviet palace in tsarskoye in the regimental staff automobile . still the crowds of workers soldiers and sailors pouring in and out still the choking press of trucks armoured cars cannon before the door and the shouting the laughter of unwonted victory . half a dozen red guards forced their way through a priest in the middle . this was father ivan they said who had blessed the cossacks when they entered the town . i heard afterward that he was shot . . . . see app . ix sect . 4 dybenko was just coming out giving rapid orders right and left . in his hand he carried the big revolver . an automobile stood with racing engine at the kerb . alone he climbed in the rear seat and was offoff to gatchina to conquer kerensky . toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town and went on afoot . what dybenko told the cossacks nobody knows but the fact is that general krasnov and his staff and several thousand cossacks surrendered and advised kerensky to do the same . see app . ix sect . 5 as for kerenskyi reprint here the deposition made by general krasnov on the morning of november 14th gatchina november 14 1917 . today about three oclock a . m . i was summoned by the supreme commander kerensky . he was very agitated and very nervous . general he said to me you have betrayed me . your cossacks declare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to the sailors . yes i answered there is talk of it and i know that you have no sympathy anywhere . but the officers say the same thing . yes most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you . what shall i do i ought to commit suicide if you are an honorable man you will go immediately to petrograd with a white flag you will present yourself to the military revolutionary committee and enter into negotiations as chief of the provisional government . all right . i will do that general . i will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you . no no not a sailor . do you know whether it is true that dybenko is here i dont know who dybenko is . he is my enemy . there is nothing to do . if you play for high stakes you must know how to take a chance . yes . ill leave tonight why that would be a flight . leave calmly and openly so that every one can see that you are not running away . very well . but you must give me a guard on which i can count . good . i went out and called the cossack russkov of the tenth regiment of the don and ordered him to pick out ten cossacks to accompany the supreme commander . half an hour later the cossacks came to tell me that kerensky was not in his quarters that he had run away . i gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for supposing that he could not have left gatchina but he could not be found . . . . and so kerensky fled alone disguised in the uniform of a sailor and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among the russian masses . . . . i went back to petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck driven by a workman and filled with red guards . we had no kerosene so our lights were not burning . the road was crowded with the proletarian army going home and new reserves pouring out to take their places . immense trucks like ours columns of artillery wagons loomed up in the night without lights as we were . we hurtled furiously on wrenched right and left to avoid collisions that seemed inevitable scraping wheels followed by the epithets of pedestrians . across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital immeasurably more splendid by night than by day like a dike of jewels heaped on the barren plain . the old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand while with the other he swept the fargleaming capital in an exultant gesture . mine he cried his face all alight . all mine now my petrograd chapter x moscow the military revolutionary committee with a fierce intensity followed up its victory november 14th . to all army corps divisional and regimental committees to all soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies to all all all . conforming to the agreement between the cossacks yunkers soldiers sailors and workers it has been decided to arraign alexander feodorvitch kerensky before a tribunal of the people . we demand that kerensky be arrested and that he be ordered in the name of the organisations hereinafter mentioned to come immediately to petrograd and present himself to the tribunal . signed the cossacks of the first division of ussuri cavalry the committee of yunkers of the petrograd detachment of franctireurs the delegate of the fifth army . peoples commissar dybenko . the committee for salvation the duma the central committee of the socialist revolutionary partyproudly claiming kerensky as a memberall passionately protested that he could only be held responsible to the constituent assembly . on the evening of november 16th i watched two thousand red guards swing down the zagorodny prospekt behind a military band playing the marseillaiseand how appropriate it soundedwith bloodred flags over the dark ranks of workmen to welcome home again their brothers who had defended red petrograd . in the bitter dusk they tramped men and women their tall bayonets swaying through streets faintly lighted and slippery with mud between silent crowds of bourgeois contemptuous but fearful . . . . all were against thembusiness men speculators investors landowners army officers politicians teachers students professional men shopkeepers clerks agents . the other socialist parties hated the bolsheviki with an implacable hatred . on the side of the soviets were the rank and file of the workers the sailors all the undemoralised soldiers the landless peasants and a fewa very fewintellectuals . . . . from the farthest corners of great russia whereupon desperate streetfighting burst like a wave news of kerenskys defeat came echoing back the immense roar of proletarian victory . kazan saratov novgorod vinnitzawhere the streets had run with blood moscow where the bolsheviki had turned their artillery against the last stronghold of the bourgeoisiethe kremlin . they are bombarding the kremlin the news passed from mouth to mouth in the streets of petrograd almost with a sense of terror . travellers from white and shining little mother moscow told fearful tales . thousands killed the tverskaya and the kuznetsky most in flames the church of vasili blazheiny a smoking ruin usspensky cathedral crumbling down the spasskaya gate of the kremlin tottering the duma burned to the ground . see app . x sect . 1 nothing that the bolsheviki had done could compare with this fearful blasphemy in the heart of holy russia . to the ears of the devout sounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the holy orthodox church and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the russian nation . . . . on november 15th lunatcharsky commissar of education broke into tears at the session of the council of peoples commissars and rushed from the room crying i cannot stand it i cannot bear the monstrous destruction of beauty and tradition . . . . that afternoon his letter of resignation was published in the newspapers i have just been informed by people arriving from moscow what has happened there . the cathedral of st . basil the blessed the cathedral of the assumption are being bombarded . the kremlin where are now gathered the most important art treasures of petrograd and of moscow is under artillery fire . there are thousands of victims . the fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of bestial ferocity . what is left what more can happen i cannot bear this . my cup is full . i am unable to endure these horrors . it is impossible to work under the pressure of thoughts which drive me mad that is why i am leaving the council of peoples commissars . i fully realise the gravity of this decision . but i can bear no more . . . . see app . x sect . 2 that same day the white guards and yunkers in the kremlin surrendered and were allowed to march out unharmed . the treaty of peace follows 1 . the committee of public safety ceases to exist . 2 . the white guard gives up its arms and dissolves . the officers retain their swords and regulations sidearms . in the military schools are retained only the arms necessary for instruction all others are surrendered by the yunkers . the military revolutionary committee guarantees the liberty and inviolability of the person . 3 . to settle the question of disarmament as set forth in section 2 a special commission is appointed consisting of representatives from all organisations which took part in the peace negotiations . 4 . from the moment of the signature of this peace treaty both parties shall immediately give order to cease firing and halt all military operations taking measures to ensure punctual obedience to this order . 5 . at the signature of the treaty all prisoners made by the two parties shall be released . . . . for two days now the bolsheviki had been in control of the city . the frightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek their dead the barricades in the streets were being removed . instead of diminishing however the stories of destruction in moscow continued to grow . . . . and it was under the influence of these fearful reports that we decided to go there . petrograd after all in spite of being for a century the seat of government is still an artificial city . moscow is real russia russia as it was and will be in moscow we would get the true feeling of the russian people about the revolution . life was more intense there . for the past week the petrograd military revolutionary committee aided by the rank and file of the railway workers had seized control of the nicolai railroad and hurled trainload after trainload of sailors and red guards southwest . . . . we were provided with passes from smolny without which no one could leave the capital . . . . when the train backed into the station a mob of shabby soldiers all carrying huge sacks of eatables stormed the doors smashed the windows and poured into all the compartments filling up the aisles and even climbing onto the roof . three of us managed to wedge our way into a compartment but almost immediately about twenty soldiers entered . . . . there was room for only four people we argued expostulated and the conductor joined usbut the soldiers merely laughed . were they to bother about the comfort of a lot of boorzhui bourgeois we produced the passes from smolny instantly the soldiers changed their attitude . come comrades cried one these are american tovarishtchi . they have come thirty thousand versts to see our revolution and they are naturally tired . . . . with polite and friendly apologies the soldiers began to leave . shortly afterward we heard them breaking into a compartment occupied by two stout welldressed russians who had bribed the conductor and locked their door . . . . about seven oclock in the evening we drew out of the station an immense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood and stumbled along slowly with many stops . the soldiers on the roof kicked with their heels and sang whining peasant songs and in the corridor so jammed that it was impossible to pass violent political debates raged all night long . occasionally the conductor came through as a matter of habit looking for tickets . he found very few except ours and after a halfhour of futile wrangling lifted his arms despairingly and withdrew . the atmosphere was stifling full of smoke and foul odours if it hadnt been for the broken windows we would doubtless have smothered during the night . in the morning hours late we looked out upon a snowy world . it was bitter cold . about noon a peasant woman got on with a basketfull of breadchunks and a great can of luke warm coffeesubstitute . from then on until dark there was nothing but the packed train jolting and stopping and occasional stations where a ravenous mob swooped down on the scantilyfurnished buffet and swept it clean . . . . at one of these halts i ran into nogin and rykov the seceding commissars who were returning to moscow to put their grievances before their own soviet 1and further along was bukharin a short redbearded man with the eyes of a fanaticmore left than lenin they said of him . . . . then the three strokes of the bell and we made a rush for the train worming our way through the packed and noisy aisle . . . . a goodnatured crowd bearing the discomfort with humorous patience interminably arguing about everything from the situation in petrograd to the british tradeunion system and disputing loudly with the few boorzhui who were on board . before we reached moscow almost every car had organised a committee to secure and distribute food and these committees became divided into political factions who wrangled over fundamental principles . . . . the station at moscow was deserted . we went to the office of the commissar in order to arrange for our return tickets . he was a sullen youth with the shoulderstraps of a lieutenant when we showed him our papers from smolny he lost his temper and declared that he was no bolshevik that he represented the committee of public safety . . . . it was characteristicin the general turmoil attending the conquest of the city the chief railway station had been forgotten by the victors . . . . not a cab in sight . a few blocks down the street however we woke up a grotesquelypadded izvostchik asleep upright on the box of his little sleigh . how much to the centre of the town he scratched his head . the barini wont be able to find a room in any hotel he said . but ill take you around for a hundred rubles . . . . before the revolution it cost two we objected but he simply shrugged his shoulders . it takes a good deal of courage to drive a sleigh nowadays he went on . we could not beat him down below fifty . . . . as we sped along the silent snowy halflighted streets he recounted his adventures during the six days fighting . driving along or waiting for a fare on the corner he said all of a sudden pooff a cannon ball exploding here pooff a cannon ball there rattratt a machinegun . . . . i gallop the devils shooting all around . i get to a nice quiet street and stop doze a little pooff another cannon ball rattratt . . . . devils devils devils brrr in the centre of the town the snowpiled streets were quiet with the stillness of convalescence . only a few arclights were burning only a few pedestrians hurried along the sidewalks . an icy wind blew from the great plain cutting to the bone . at the first hotel we entered an office illuminated by two candles . yes we have some very comfortable rooms but all the windows are shot out . if the gospodin does not mind a little fresh air . . . . down the tverskaya the shopwindows were broken and there were shellholes and tornup paving stones in the street . hotel after hotel all full or the proprietors still so frightened that all they could say was no no there is no room there is no room on the main streets where the great bankinghouses and mercantile houses lay the bolshevik artillery had been indiscriminately effective . as one soviet official told me whenever we didnt know just where the yunkers and white guards were we bombarded their pocketbooks . . . . at the big hotel national they finally took us in for we were foreigners and the military revolutionary committee had promised to protect the dwellings of foreigners . . . . on the top floor the manager showed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows . the animals said he shaking his first at imaginary bolsheviki . but wait their time will come in just a few days now their ridiculous government will fall and then we shall make them suffer we dined at a vegetarian restaurant with the enticing name i eat nobody and tolstoys picture prominent on the walls and then sallied out into the streets . the headquarters of the moscow soviet was in the palace of the former governorgeneral an imposing white building fronting skobeliev square . red guards stood sentry at the door . at the head of the wide formal stairway whose walls were plastered with announcements of committeemeetings and addresses of political parties we passed through a series of lofty anterooms hung with redshrouded pictures in gold frames to the splendid state salon with its magnificent crystal lustres and gilded cornices . a lowvoiced hum of talk underlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing machines filled the place . huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth were unrolled serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables at which sat half a hundred women cutting and sewing streamers and banners for the funeral of the revolutionary dead . the faces of these women were roughened and scarred with life at its most difficult they worked now sternly many of them with eyes red from weeping . . . . the losses of the red army had been heavy . at a desk in one corner was rogov an intelligent bearded man with glasses wearing the black blouse of a worker . he invited us to march with the central executive committee in the funeral procession next morning . . . . it is impossible to teach the socialist revolutionaries and the mensheviki anything he exclaimed . they compromise from sheer habit . imagine they proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the yunkers graphic page251 questionairre for the bourgeoioisie distributed to all bourgeois households in moscow by the moscow military revolutionary commitee so as to provide a basis for the requisition of clothing for the army and the poor workers . for translation see appendix 3 . see app . x sect . 3 across the hall came a man in a ragged soldiercoat and shapka whose face was familiar i recognised melnichansky whom i had known as the watchmaker george melcher in bayonne new jersey during the great standard oil strike . now he told me he was secretary of the moscow metalworkers union and a commissar of the military revolutionary committee during the fighting . . . . you see me he cried showing his decrepit clothing . i was with the boys in the kremlin when the yunkers came the first time . they shut me up in the cellar and swiped my overcoat my money watch and even the ring on my finger . this is all ive got to wear from him i learned many details of the bloody sixday battle which had rent moscow in two . unlike in petrograd in moscow the city duma had taken command of the yunkers and white guards . rudnev the mayor and minor president of the duma had directed the activities of the committee of public safety and the troops . riabtsev commandant of the city a man of democratic instincts had hesitated about opposing the military revolutionary committee but the duma had forced him . . . . it was the mayor who had urged the occupation of the kremlin they will never dare fire on you there he said . . . . one garrison regiment badly demoralised by long inactivity had been approached by both sides . the regiment held a meeting to decide what action to take . resolved that the regiment remain neutral and continue its present activitieswhich consisted in peddling rubbers and sunflower seeds but worst of all said melnichansky we had to organise while we were fighting . the other side knew just what it wanted but here the soldiers had their soviet and the workers theirs . . . . there was a fearful wrangle over who should be commanderinchief some regiments talked for days before they decided what to do and when the officers suddenly deserted us we had no battlestaff to give orders . . . . vivid little pictures he gave me . on a cold grey day he had stood at a corner of the nikitskaya which was swept by blasts of machinegun fire . a throng of little boys were gathered therestreet waifs who used to be newsboys . shrill excited as if with a new game they waited until the firing slackened and then tried to run across the street . . . . many were killed but the rest dashed backward and forward laughing daring each other . . . . late in the evening i went to the dvorianskoye sobraniethe nobles clubwhere the moscow bolsheviki were to meet and consider the report of nogin rykov and the others who had left the council of peoples commissars . the meetingplace was a theatre in which under the old rgime to audiences of officers and glittering ladies amateur presentations of the latest french comedy had once taken place . at first the place filled with the intellectualsthose who lived near the centre of the town . nogin spoke and most of his listeners were plainly with him . it was very late before the workers arrived the workingclass quarters were on the outskirts of the town and no streetcars were running . but about midnight they began to clump up the stairs in groups of ten or twentybig rough men in coarse clothes fresh from the battleline where they had fought like devils for a week seeing their comrades fall all about them . scarcely had the meeting formally opened before nogin was assailed with a tempest of jeers and angry shouts . in vain he tried to argue to explain they would not listen . he had left the council of peoples commissars he had deserted his post while the battle was raging . as for the bourgeois press here in moscow there was no more bourgeois press even the city

requests to give a pass for the purpose of investigating the kremlin the representatives of the american socialist party attached to the socialist press comrades reed and bryant . chief of the military revolutionary committee for the secretary late in the night we went through the empty streets and under the iberian gate to the great red square in front of the kremlin . the church of vasili blazheiny loomed fantastic its brightcoloured convoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in the darkness . there was no sign of any damage . . . . along one side of the square the dark towers and walls of the kremlin stood up . on the high walls flickered redly the light of hidden flames voices reached us across the immense place and the sound of picks and shovels . we crossed over . mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall . climbing these we looked down into two massive pits ten or fifteen feet deep and fifty yards long where hundreds of soldiers and workers were digging in the light of huge fires . a young student spoke to us in german . the brotherhood grave he explained . tomorrow we shall bury here five hundred proletarians who died for the revolution . he took us down into the pit . in frantic haste swung the picks and shovels and the earthmountains grew . no one spoke . overhead the night was thick with stars and the ancient imperial kremlin wall towered up immeasurably . here in this holy place said the student holiest of all russia we shall bury our most holy . here where are the tombs of the tsars our tsarthe peopleshall sleep . . . . his arm was in a sling from a bulletwound gained in the fighting . he looked at it . you foreigners look down on us russians because so long we tolerated a medival monarchy said he . but we saw that the tsar was not the only tyrant in the world capitalism was worse and in all the countries of the world capitalism was emperor . . . . russian revolutionary tactics are best . . . . as we left the workers in the pit exhausted and running with sweat in spite of the cold began to climb wearily out . across the red square a dark knot of men came hurrying . they swarmed into the pits picked up the tools and began digging digging without a word . . . . so all the long night volunteers of the people relieved each other never halting in their driving speed and the cold light of the dawn laid bare the great square white with snow and the yawning brown pits of the brotherhood grave quite finished . we rose before sunrise and hurried through the dark streets to skobeliev square . in all the great city not a human being could be seen but there was a faint sound of stirring far and near like a deep wind coming . in the pale halflight a little group of men and women were gathered before the soviet headquarters with a sheaf of goldlettered red bannersthe central executive committee of the moscow soviets . it grew light . from afar the vague stirring sound deepened and became louder a steady and tremendous bass . the city was rising . we set out down the tverskaya the banners flapping overhead . the little street chapels along our way were locked and dark as was the chapel of the iberian virgin which each new tsar used to visit before he went to the kremlin to crown himself and which day or night was always open and crowded and brilliant with the candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and jewels of the ikons . now for the first time since napoleon was in moscow they say the candles were out . the holy orthodox church had withdrawn the light of its countenance from moscow the nest of irreverent vipers who had bombarded the kremlin . dark and silent and cold were the churches the priests had disappeared . there were no popes to officiate at the red burial there had been no sacrament for the dead nor were any prayers to be said over the grave of the blasphemers . tikhon metropolitan of moscow was soon to excommunicate the soviets . . . . also the shops were closed and the propertied classes stayed at homebut for other reasons . this was the day of the people the rumour of whose coming was thunderous as surf . . . . already through the iberian gate a human river was flowing and the vast red square was spotted with people thousands of them . i remarked that as the throng passed the iberian chapel where always before the passerby had crossed himself they did not seem to notice it . . . . we forced our way through the dense mass packed near the kremlin wall and stood upon one of the dirtmountains . already several men were there among them muranov the soldier who had been elected commandant of moscowa tall simplelooking bearded man with a gentle face . through all the streets to the red square the torrents of people poured thousands upon thousands of them all with the look of the poor and the toiling . a military band came marching up playing the internationale and spontaneously the song caught and spread like windripples on a sea slow and solemn . from the top of the kremlin wall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground red with great letters in gold and in white saying martyrs of the beginning of world social revolution and long live the brotherhood of workers of the world . a bitter wind swept the square lifting the banners . now from the far quarters of the city the workers of the different factories were arriving with their dead . they could be seen coming through the gate the blare of their banners and the dull redlike bloodof the coffins they carried . these were rude boxes made of unplaned wood and daubed with crimson borne high on the shoulders of rough men who marched with tears streaming down their faces and followed by women who sobbed and screamed or walked stiffly with white dead faces . some of the coffins were open the lid carried behind them others were covered with gilded or silvered cloth or had a soldiers hat nailed on the top . there were many wreaths of hideous artificial flowers . . . . through an irregular lane that opened and closed again the procession slowly moved toward us . now through the gate was flowing an endless stream of banners all shades of red with silver and gold lettering knots of crepe hanging from the topand some anarchist flags black with white letters . the band was playing the revolutionary funeral march and against the immense singing of the mass of people standing uncovered the paraders sang hoarsely choked with sobs . . . . between the factoryworkers came companies of soldiers with their coffins too and squadrons of cavalry riding at salute and artillery batteries the cannon wound with red and blackforever it seemed . their banners said long live the third international or we want an honest general democratic peace slowly the marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of the grave and the bearers clambered up with their burdens and went down into the pit . many of them were womensquat strong proletarian women . behind the dead came other womenwomen young and broken or old wrinkled women making noises like hurt animals who tried to follow their sons and husbands into the brotherhood grave and shrieked when compassionate hands restrained them . the poor love each other so all the long day the funeral procession passed coming in by the iberian gate and leaving the square by way of the nikolskaya a river of red banners bearing words of hope and brotherhood and stupendous prophecies against a background of fifty thousand peopleunder the eyes of the worlds workers and their descendants forever . . . . one by one the five hundred coffins were laid in the pits . dusk fell and still the banners came drooping and fluttering the band played the funeral march and the huge assemblage chanted . in the leafless branches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung like strange multicoloured blossoms . two hundred men began to shovel in the dirt . it rained dully down upon the coffins with a thudding sound audible beneath the singing . . . . the lights came out . the last banners passed and the last moaning women looking back with awful intensity as they went . slowly from the great square ebbed the proletarian tide . . . . i suddenly realised that the devout russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven . on earth they were building a kingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer and for which it was a glory to die . . . . chapter xi the conquest of power see app . xi sect . 1 declaration of the rights of the peoples of russia see app . xi sect . 2 . . . the first congress of soviets in june of this year proclaimed the right of the peoples of russia to selfdetermination . the second congress of soviets in november last confirmed this inalienable right of the peoples of russia more decisively and definitely . executing the will of these congresses the council of peoples commissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity in the question of nationalities the following principles 1 the equality and sovereignty of the peoples of russia . 2 the right of the peoples of russia to free selfdetermination even to the point of separation and the formation of an independent state . 3 the abolition of any and all national and national religious privileges and disabilities . 4 the free development of national minorities and ethnographic groups inhabiting the territory of russia . decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of a commission on nationalities . in the name of the russian republic peoples commissar for nationalities yussov djugashvilistalin president of the council of peoples commissars v . ulianov lenin the central rada at kiev immediately declared ukraine an independent republic as did the government of finland through the senate at helsingfors . independent governments spring up in siberia and the caucasus . the polish chief military committee swiftly gathered together the polish troops in the russian army abolished their committees and established an iron discipline . . . . all these governments and movements had two characteristics in common they were controlled by the propertied classes and they feared and detested bolshevism . . . . steadily amid the chaos of shocking change the council of peoples commissars hammered at the scaffolding of the socialist order . decree on social insurance on workers control regulations for volost land committees abolition of ranks and titles abolition of courts and the creation of peoples tribunals . . . . see app . xi sect . 3 army after army fleet after fleet sent deputations joyfully to greet the new government of the people . in front of smolny one day i saw a ragged regiment just come from the trenches . the soldiers were drawn up before the great gates thin and greyfaced looking up at the building as if god were in it . some pointed out the imperial eagles over the door laughing . . . . red guards came to mount guard . all the soldiers turned to look curiously as if they had heard of them but never seen them . they laughed goodnaturedly and pressed out of line to slap the red guards on the back with halfjoking halfadmiring remarks . . . . the provisional government was no more . on november 15th in all the churches of the capital the priests stopped praying for it . but as lenin himself told the tsayeekah that was only the beginning of the conquest of power . deprived of arms the opposition which still controlled the economic life of the country settled down to organise disorganisation with all the russian genius for cooperative actionto obstruct cripple and discredit the soviets . the strike of government employees was well organised financed by the banks and commercial establishments . every move of the bolsheviki to take over the government apparatus was resisted . trotzky went to the ministry of foreign affairs the functionaries refused to recognise him locked themselves in and when the doors were forced resigned . he demanded the keys of the archives only when he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up . then it was discovered that neratov former assistant foreign minister had disappeared with the secret treaties . . . . shliapnikov tried to take possession of the ministry of labour . it was bitterly cold and there was no one to light the fires . of all the hundreds of employees not one would show him where the office of the minister was . . . . alexandra kollontai appointed the 13th of november commissar of public welfarethe department of charities and public institutionswas welcomed with a strike of all but forty of the functionaries in the ministry . immediately the poor of the great cities the inmates of institutions were plunged in miserable want delegations of starving cripples of orphans with blue pinched faces besieged the building . with tears streaming down her face kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keys of the office and the safe when she got the keys however it was discovered that the former minister countess panina had gone off with all the funds which she refused to surrender except on the order of the constituent assembly . see app . xi sect . 4 in the ministry of agriculture the ministry of supplies the ministry of finance similar incidents occurred . and the employees summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions either stayed away or returned to sabotage . . . . almost all the intelligentzia being antibolshevik there was nowhere for the soviet government to recruit new staffs . . . . the private banks remained stubbornly closed with a back door open for speculators . when bolshevik commissars entered the clerks left secreting the books and removing the funds . all the employees of the state bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and the manufacture of money who refused all demands from smolny and privately paid out huge sums to the committee for salvation and the city duma . twice a commissar with a company of red guards came formally to insist upon the delivery of large sums for government expenses . the first time the city duma members and the menshevik and socialist revolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers and spoke so gravely of the consequences that the commissar was frightened . the second time he arrived with a warrant which he proceeded to read aloud in due form but some one called his attention to the fact that it had no date and no seal and the traditional russian respect for documents forced him again to withdraw . . . . the officials of the credit chancery destroyed their books so that all record of the financial relations of russia with foreign countries was lost . the supply committees the administrations of the municipalowned public utilities either did not work at all or sabotaged . and when the bolsheviki compelled by the desperate needs of the city population attempted to help or to control the public service all the employees went on strike immediately and the duma flooded russia with telegrams about bolshevik violation of municipal autonomy . at military headquarters and in the offices of the ministries of war and marine where the old officials had consented to work the army committees and the high command blocked the soviets in every way possible even to the extent of neglecting the troops at the front . the vikzhel was hostile refusing to transport soviet troops every trooptrain that left petrograd was taken out by force and railway officials had to be arrested each timewhereupon the vikzhel threatened an immediate general strike unless they were released . . . . smolny was plainly powerless . the newspapers said that all the factories of petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in three weeks the vikzhel announced that trains must cease running by december first there was food for three days only in petrograd and no more coming in and the army on the front was starving . . . . the committee for salvation the various central committees sent word all over the country exhorting the population to ignore the government decrees . and the allied embassies were either coldly indifferent or openly hostile . . . . the opposition newspapers suppressed one day and reappearing next morning under new names heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime . see app . xi sect . 5 even novaya zhizn characterised it as a combination of demagoguery and impotence . from day to day it said the government of the peoples commissars sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste . having easily conquered the power . . . the bolsheviki can not make use of it . powerless to direct the existing mechanism of government they are unable at the same time to create a new one which might work easily and freely according to the theories of social experimenters . just a little while ago the bolsheviki hadnt enough men to run their growing partya work above all of speakers and writers where then are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse and complicated functions of government the new government acts and threatens it sprays the country with decrees each one more radical and more socialist than the last . but in this exhibition of socialism on papermore likely designed for the stupefaction of our descendantsthere appears neither the desire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day meanwhile the vikzhels conference to form a new government continued to meet night and day . both sides had already agreed in principle to the basis of the government the composition of the peoples council was being discussed the cabinet was tentatively chosen with tchernov as premier the bolsheviki were admitted in a large minority but lenin and trotzky were barred . the central committees of the menshevik and socialist revolutionary parties the executive committee of the peasants soviets resolved that although unalterably opposed to the criminal politics of the bolsheviki they would in order to halt the fratricidal bloodshed not oppose their entrance into the peoples council . the flight of kerensky however and the astounding success of the soviets everywhere altered the situation . on the 16th in a meeting of the tsayeekah the left socialist revolutionaries insisted that the bolsheviki should form a coalition government with the other socialist parties otherwise they would withdraw from the military revolutionary committee and the tsayeekah . malkin said the news from moscow where our comrades are dying on both sides of the barricades determines us to bring up once more the question of organisation of power and it is not only our right to do so but our duty . . . . we have won the right to sit with the bolsheviki here within the walls of smolny institute and to speak from this tribune . after the bitter internal party struggle we shall be obliged if you refuse to compromise to pass to open battle outside . . . . we must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptable compromise . . . . after a recess to consider this ultimatum the bolsheviki returned with a resolution read by kameniev the tsayeekah considers it necessary that there enter into the government representatives of all the socialist parties composing the soviets of workers soldiers and peasants deputies who recognise the conquests of the revolution of november 7ththat is to say the establishment of a government of soviets the decrees on peace land workers control over industry and the arming of the workingclass . the tsayeekah therefore resolves to propose negotiations concerning the constitution of the government to all parties of the soviet and insists upon the following conditions as a basis the government is responsible to the tsayeekah . the tsayeekah shall be enlarged to 150 members . to these 150 delegates of the soviets of workers and soldiers deputies shall be added 75 delegates of the provincial soviets of peasants deputies 80 from the front organisations of the army and navy 40 from the trade unions 25 from the various allrussian unions in proportion to their importance 10 from the vikzhel and 5 from the post and telegraph workers and 50 delegates from the socialist groups in the petrograd city duma . in the ministry itself at least onehalf the portfolios must be reserved to the bolsheviki . the ministries of labour interior and foreign affairs must be given to the bolsheviki . the command of the garrisons of petrograd and moscow must remain in the hands of delegates of the moscow and petrograd soviets . the government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers of all russia . it is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades lenin and trotzky . kameniev explained . the socalled peoples council he said proposed by the conference would consist of about 420 members of which about 150 would be bolsheviki . besides there would be delegates from the counterrevolutionary old tsayeekah 100 members chosen by the municipal dumaskornilovtsi all 100 delegates from the peasants sovietsappointed by avksentiev and 80 from the old army committees who no longer represent the soldier masses . we refuse to admit the old tsayeekah and also the representatives of the municipal dumas . the delegates from the peasants soviets shall be elected by the congress of peasants which we have called and which will at the same time elect a new executive committee . the proposal to exclude lenin and trotzky is a proposal to decapitate our party and we do not accept it . and finally we see no necessity for a peoples council anyway the soviets are open to all socialist parties and the tsayeekah represents them in their real proportions among the masses . . . . karelin for the left socialist revolutionaries declared that his party would vote for the bolshevik resolution reserving the right to modify certain details such as the representation of the peasants and demanding that the ministry of agriculture be reserved for the left socialist revolutionaries . this was agreed to . . . . later at a meeting of the petrograd soviet trotzky answered a question about the formation of the new government i dont know anything about that . i am not taking part in the negotiations . . . . however i dont think that they are of great importance . . . . that night there was great uneasiness in the conference . the delegates of the city duma withdrew . . . . but at smolny itself in the ranks of the bolshevik party a formidable opposition to lenins policy was growing . on the night of november 17th the great hall was packed and ominous for the meeting of the tsayeekah . larin bolshevik declared that the moment of elections to the constituent assembly approached and it was time to do away with political terrorism . the measures
